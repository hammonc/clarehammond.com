  <p><br>'As one of today’s most successful composers of this younger generation, Kenneth Hesketh, has piano music that is unusually expressive and multi-layered – and Clare Hammond, who premiered his work, is an exceptional interpreter. The record is named after his twelve-part time-based series named <em>Horae</em>, subtitled <em>Breviary for Clare</em> (written for Clare Hammond).</p><br> 
<p>Hesketh shows that it is possible to create new, evocative music within the fairly traditional new piano music idiom. Under the seemingly generic surface of Hesketh’s music, we have all sorts of processes – sometimes moving at the same time, but usually beginning at different times. There is drama and there are many layers– overall there are multidimensional sounds. Hammond brings these through with concentration and refinement.'</p><br>
