  <p><br>"But anyway, venues were crowded and no wonder. Take the Lason Ensemble Concert (July 14, Witkiewicz Theatre) or Clare Hammond’s recital (July 11, Orski Gallery). Imaginatively selected repertoire (Szymanowski, Lason, Panufnik) and an excellent performer. Clare Hammond is a feature of the British music scene, acclaimed by critics for strength, precision and musicality, which was only confirmed by her recital in Zakopane. (Hammond, incidentally, will perform at the “Chopin and his Europe” Festival on August 25)."</p><br>
