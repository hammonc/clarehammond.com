		<p>November has been a busy month with nine performances across the UK including a last-minute engagement at the <strong><a href="http://www.cadoganhall.com/" target="_blank">Cadogan Hall</a></strong> when Clare stepped in to perform Bach's fifth Brandenburg Concerto and Vaughan Williams' Piano Quintet with the London International Players. She visited the Holywell Music Room in Oxford a few days later to perform works by <strong><a href="http://robertsaxton.net/" target="_blank">Robert Saxton</a></strong> as part of his 60th birthday celebrations, described as a 'breath-taking' performance by the <strong><a href="http://clarehammond.com/reviews.html"target="_blank">Oxford Magazine</a></strong>. Towards the end of the month, Clare gave the world premiere of <em>Flight of the Killer Bee</em> by Ewan Campbell, a humorous take on Rimsky-Korsakov's <em>Flight of the Bumblebee</em>, which she will be programming in spring 2014.</p>

		<p>2013 has seen premieres of works by composers Ed Hughes, Robert Saxton, Ken Hesketh and Robert Peate at the Brighton, City of London, Cheltenham and Presteigne Festivals, four BBC radio <strong><a href="http://clarehammond.com/recordings.html"target="_blank">broadcasts</a></strong>, and two CDs for BIS records which will be released in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Full details of past engagements are available on Clare's concerts <strong><a href="http://clarehammond.com/archive.html" target="_blank">archive</a></strong>. There are lots of exciting projects planned for 2014, of which more in January. In the meantime, have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>
