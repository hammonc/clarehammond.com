title: Brandenburg 5 with the Constella Ensemble, 15 July 2012

<p>I'm sat at the back of this beautiful church listening to the Constella Ensemble rehearse Mozart's Flute Quartet. In a few minutes we'll start working on Bach's fifth Brandenburg Concerto which will form the finale to the programme this afternoon. This will be my last concert of the season, as I'll be taking a break from performing in August, and, funnily enough, I feel much more relaxed than I would normally an hour before a concert!</p> 

<p>We performed this programme, with Mozart's flute quartet, Schubert's string trio, a Serenade by Reger for flute, violin and viola, and Bach's fifth Brandenburg concerto, at St Stephen Walbrook on Tuesday so the repertoire now feels familiar. The first performance of a new programme is always nerve-wracking but I'm hoping that today we'll be able to play freely and to experiment a little. As at St Stephen's, there is a considerable echo here so the principal challenge is to project clarity as the sound bounces around the church. It is lovely performing in venues in London which I've often walked past but never explored. I've already said what a gem St Stephen's is, and St George's is equally fascinating. The portico is reputed to be the 'most grandiose of London's 18th-century church fronts' and was based on the Temple of Jupiter at Baalbek in the Lebanon.</p>

<p>After this concert, I'll head back home and settle down for a month of note-learning at the piano. I'm really looking forward to getting my teeth into some new repertoire and starting work on projects which have been in the pipeline for months now. All that remains is for the weather to improve, and then I should have a perfect summer in store!</p
