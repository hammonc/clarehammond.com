<p>I gave a Saturday afternoon recital in the Barbirolli Room at the Bridgewater Hall as part of the 'Reflections on Debussy' series, curated by the pianist Noriko Ogawa and Peter Davison. The series itself is tremendously imaginative and ambitious. My recital was just the first of many events that evening which included a calligraphy workshop, pre-concert talk on Takemitsu, a monumental concert with the BBC Philharmonic and Noriko Ogawa playing Takemitsu's <em>Riverrun</em> concerto, followed by a post-concert performance of Japanese cabaret songs. As I had played early on I was able to sit back and enjoy all of these events, particularly Noriko's performance which was inspiring. I also realised with a start what a pleasure it is to listen to music which I am not playing myself. I've been focussing so intently on my own work recently that I'd evidently grown tired of listening to myself play (and obviously need to get out more!)</p>

<p>So I now need to prepare a programme of Liszt, Debussy, Martin and Beethoven for Tuesday evening at the Caledonian Club in London and then I can rest for a while. I must say that I'm looking forward to a few days at home. While I love giving concerts, I'm not a huge fan of traveling between venues, although some of the views on the train line from Manchester compensate for the effort!</p>
