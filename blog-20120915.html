<p>After a summer beavering away at home, I'm now back on the concert platform and opened the Autumn season with a concert of chamber music. I have recently started collaborating with the <a href="http://www.goldfieldensemble.co.uk/" target="_blank">Goldfield Ensemble</a>, a group of musicians based in Hertfordshire which draws upon players from the Britten Sinfonia and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This concert was a relatively small affair with two trios for clarinet, viola and piano. It was a real joy to perform with clarinettist Kate Romano and violist Mike Leaver, and to be introduced to a new venue. Pianist <a href="http://www.philipmead.com/home/index.php" target="_blank">Philip Mead</a> runs a concert series at St Augustine's in North Cambridge, which is particularly valued by the local community.</p>

<p>We opened our concert with one of the key works for this repertoire, Mozart's 'Kegelstatt' trio, which was followed by a lesser known work, a trio by the French composer, Jean Fran&#231;aix. Fran&#231;aix was a twentieth-century composer and his music is resolutely neoclassical, drawing on styles as diverse as the Viennese waltz, burlesca and serenade. This trio is notable for its comical character, occasionally verging on slapstick. At times it felt as if we should be playing incidental music for a troupe of clowns in a circus! It's very difficult to get a complete idea of this music in rehearsal. You really need an audience to bring it to life so it was particularly satisfying to give our first performance of this trio in concert.</p>
