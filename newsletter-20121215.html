		<p>Clare's BBC recording of six etudes by Korean composer <strong><a href="http://www.boosey.com/composer/unsuk+chin" target="_blank">Unsuk Chin</a></strong> will be broadcast by BBC Radio 3 as part of <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tnsx" target="_blank">Hear and Now</a></strong> on the evening of Saturday 5 January. Composed between 1995 and 2003, these fascinating studies are natural successors to the etudes by Gy&#246;rgy Ligeti and are already of international prominence. With their scintillating textures and inventive use of timbre, they are absorbing and electrifying works which are sure to become a keystone of the piano repertoire. Tune in on the 5th or listen on <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/" target="_blank">BBC iPlayer</a></strong> until the 12th January.</p>
		<p>In October Clare gave world premieres of two recently discovered pieces by <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Harty" target="_blank">Hamilton Harty</a></strong> as part of her <a href="http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/5280/0/1/classical-review-clare-hammond" target="_blank">inaugural recital</a> as Artist-in-Residence at Queen's University Belfast. <em>Spring Fancy</em> and <em>Portrait</em> were composed by Harty in 1934 after he fell in love with a young woman, Lorie Bolland, while sailing to Australia. Listen to the full story from Professor Jan Smaczny who was interviewed with Clare by Marie-Louise Muir for <strong>BBC Radio Ulster</strong> <a href="http://www.clarehammond.com/radio-ulster.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>2013 is shaping up to be an exciting year with engagements at the <a href="http://brightonfestival.org/guest_director_2013/" target="_blank">Brighton Festival</a>, the <a href="http://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/" target="_blank">Wigmore Hall</a> and the <a href="http://www.presteignefestival.com/" target="_blank">Presteigne Festival</a> over the summer, and two <strong><a href="http://clarehammond.com/etude_cd.html" target="_blank">solo recordings</a></strong>. Clare will also be premiering pieces written especially written for her by composers <strong>Robert Saxton</strong> and <strong>Kenneth Hesketh</strong> at the <a href="http://www.colf.org/" target="_blank">City of London Festival</a> and the <a href="http://www.cheltenhamfestivals.com/music" target="_blank">Cheltenham Festival</a>. It would be lovely if you could join her at one of these events and, in the meantime, have a very Happy New Year!</p>
