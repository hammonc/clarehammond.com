<p>I've just given the third concert of my current tour with the <a href="http://www.piattiquartet.com/" target="_blank">Piatti String Quartet</a> at <a href="http://www.stgeorgesbristol.co.uk/" target="_blank">St George's Hall</a> in Bristol. This is where we recorded our CD back in October, which was a wonderful experience, so it felt like a home-coming in many ways.</p> 

<p>The acoustic is one of the most responsive that I've come across and the piano might be the best I've played. Of all the pieces in the programme, <em>Le Tombeau de Couperin</em>, in particular, requires both precision and a truly glowing sound which can be impossible to achieve in a dry acoustic. If I'm performing it in an unfamiliar venue then I'm always nervous until I've had a chance to sit at the keyboard and experiment. Fortunately, I knew that I would be safe at St George's. In fact, with hall and instrument combined, I was spoilt rotten.</p>

<p>It was lovely to have the chance to play both <em>Tombeau</em> and the <em>Menuet sur le nom d'Haydn</em> in this particular concert as the 7 March is Ravel's birthday - 137 years old today! Satie's <em>Gnossiennes</em> provided an ethereal interlude before I finished with Albéniz's 'Evocación' and 'Triana'. I love playing these pieces and 'Triana' ends with such fire and élan. At the very end of the concert I joined the Piatti String Quartet, who had played Haydn and Debussy, in an encore. We performed the third movement of Dvorak's Piano Quintet in A which is one of the most charming pieces I've come across. The Piattis themselves are a superb quartet and it was such fun to play with them.</p>

<p>So, three down and two to go! The final two concerts of our tour will be at Farnham Maltings near Guildford on the 22 March and the Wigmore Hall in London on the 16th April. The tour has been brilliantly organised by the team at the Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust and John Woolf of the Park Lane Group. If you would like a preview, our CD is now available on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Classics/dp/B007FG5TNK/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330635811&sr=301-1" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and iTunes. We'll hope to see you at a concert soon!</p>
