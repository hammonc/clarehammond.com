  <div class="listing-heading">PLANET HUGILL, Vale of Glamorgan Festival, May 2014</div>
  <div class="listing-trailer">'… captured the piece brilliantly and dazzled with the more bravura passages' - <em>Robert Hugill</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>Penarth Pier Pavilion is a relatively new venue, a stylish new concert venue having been created in Penarth Pier as part of the 2013 renovations of the pier on the esplanade at Penarth (near Cardiff). This year's Vale of Glamorgan Music Festival has been making good use of the venue. For the festival's final visit to Penarth Pier Pavilion, on May 17, pianist Clare Hammond performed a programme of contemporary music for solo piano. Her programme consisted of a highly varied selection of generally short works, some written specifically for Hammond, including music by John Tavener, Andrew Keeling, John Metcalf, Adam Gorb, Tarik O'Regan, Peter Fribbins, Alan Mills and Robin Walker.</p><br>

<p>Hammond started with John Tavener's tiny Zodiacs (1997). It opened with a simple bell-like motif which Tavener managed to imbue with his usual fascination. The middle section repeated the same motif, but at a far faster speed, creating a rather attractive moment, before the opening returned.</p><br>

<p>Composer Andrew Keeling has a varied background, working both in contemporary classical and in rock. His Coniunctio (2013) was written for Clare Hammond and was receiving its world premiere performance.</p><br>

<p>In the piece Keeling examined the alchemical ideas of the mystical union of King and Queen / Sol and Luna. To this end, Keeling took a piece of plainchant (A Solis Ortus Cardine) and subjected it to a variety of his own transformations, merging it with his own material. The work was in seven movements, each with their own alchemical point. But I have to confess that, from first off I failed to make Keeling's descriptions tie up with what I was hearing and that I simply sat back and let the music flow. Perhaps it might have been illuminating to hear the plainchant unadorned before the piece started?</p><br>

<p>After a dramatic start, the music remained highly characterful with some magical moments. The various movements caputured a series of moods, there was quite a romantic sensibility to it but toughness as well. There was also some terrific playing from Hammond, who captured the piece brilliantly and dazzled with the more bravura passages.</p><br>

<p>Endless Song (1999) by the festival's artistic director, John Metcalf, was a flowing and elegantly lyrical piece. The basic melodic idea was quite romantic in feel, and Metcalf proceeded to vary it endlessly, keeping a feeling of constant flowing onward. Endlessly fascinating though the piece was, Metcalf wisely avoided the big gesture and kept it to a refined sensibility.</p><br>

<p>Adam Gorb is the Head of Composition at the Royal Northern College of Music. Hammond premiered his Velocity last week, so that we heard the work's second performance. The work started as an interrupted toccata, with Hammond contributing some brilliant, crisp playing. As the work continued, and the pulse got even faster, the toccata ceased to be interrupted, and Hammond brought out quite a hard edge to the music, and she certainly dazzled with the sheer virtuosity of her playing.</p><br>

<p>Tarik O'Regan is one of the festival's featured composers this year. His Lines of Desire (2005) was a short, quite romantic piece which let the music flow where it wished to, with O'Regan bringing a naturally contemplative feel to the gradually evolving melodic ideas.</p><br>

<p>O'Regan's Three Piano Miniatures (1999) could hardly be different as each movement arose from the strict manipulation of the same tone-row. The results were surprisingly characterful and dramatic. Whilst not strictly melodic, the pieces were highly involving in terms of content and form.</p><br>

<p>In 2012 the Two Rivers Festival commissioned a group of piano pieces to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Debussy. Each of the five composers wrote a short piano piece which had a link to Debussy's music. Hammond played three of these Aquarelles (2012), L'extase de jets d'eau by Peter Fribbins, Narcissus by Alan Mills and Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep by Robin Walker. L'extase de jets d'eau had a busy, flowing yet transparent texture which rippled and flowed, as if we were hearing the music refracted through flowing water. Hidden deep in the texture was Debussy's song Clair de Lune. Narcissus evoked Debussy's Reflets dans l'eau and invoked the story of Narcissus. A calm, gently rippling texture was placed agains slower moving phrases above and below, as if we were seeing Narcissus and his reflection in the water. Finally Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep evoked La Mer but here depicting the North Sea. Starting with a dark rocking figure deep in the piano, the consistently moving, dark texture had distinct hints of Debussy with in. You sensed the sea growing as the music moved up the piano, flowing and dramatic until finally it all subsided.</p><br>

<p>Hammond's programme was an imaginative collection of shorter contemporary pieces for piano, each one played with character, style and not a little bravura, her stylish playing matched by a very stylish dress. There was a good audience who were certainly knowledgeable and appreciative.</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'But then the mood turned noticeably darker and more chilling with two of O'Regan's piano miniatures, played by the excellent Clare Hammond. The pieces were short, sharp and not a little disturbing, played with the power and panache that has earned Hammond a deservedly high reputation. She was equally commanding in Robin Walker's 'Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep', from Aquarelles. Sarah Dacey, a member of the critically-acclaimed vocal ensemble Juice, joined Hammond to sing O'Regan's 'My House, I Say' and a highly amusing and entertaining piece called 'Worry / Don't Worry'.</p>

  <div class="listing-heading">ROCHDALE ONLINE, Heywood Civic Centre, Feb 2014</div>
  <div class="listing-trailer">'... held the audience enthralled all evening' - <em>Graham Marshall</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'One member of the audience was so taken with the dexterity displayed by Clare Hammond in the concert she gave for the Rochdale Music Society on Saturday, 22 February, that he went up to her at the end and asked her to show him her hands to prove that she had only ten fingers! Such was the technical brilliance of her performance, which had held the audience enthralled all evening.</p><br>

<p>Clare has made a special study of music written for the left hand only, and she demonstrated how effective such compositions can be by opening her programme with a finely judged performance of the arrangement for left hand only of a Chaconne in D minor by Bach made by Brahms.</p><br>

<p>The first of the works for two hands was a sequence of three of Mendelssohn’s Songs without Words, to which she brought delicate touches of feeling matching the composer’s charm and restrained passion and making the instrument sing.</p><br>

<p>The second was the early A major Sonata by Schubert, which she played with engaging lyrical warmth as befits music which, although it has moments of passion, is predominantly of a even tempered rather than argumentative kind.</p><br>

<p>After the interval came Mozart’s Variations on a Minuet by C. Fischer. Clare took up the composer’s invitation to join him in a journey of discovery, and made the members of the audience feel that they too were being privileged to experience the various delights uncovered as each of the twelve variations was unfolded.</p><br>

<p>The concert then took a leap into what might well have been regarded as the distant future in Mozart’s or even Mendelssohn’s time with the pieces called ‘Gnossiennes’ by the eccentric French composer, Eric Satie. Keeping the listener’s attention for the whole of this set of six pieces, played one after the other, is no mean feat for the performer, since they are all very slow and very similar both melodically and harmonically. That Clare managed to do this to the obvious delight of the audience was a tribute to her artistic sense of the spaced out time and motion underpinning Satie’s experimental technique.</p><br>

<p>Clare then worked her magic on Scriabin’s Prelude and Nocturne Op.9, two of the most romantic and endearing left hand only pieces in the repertory: intimate and restrained passion in the Prelude, arching melody and delicate Chopinesque brilliance in the Nocturne.</p><br>

<p>The concert ended with a masterful interpretation of Ginastera’s Danzas Argentinas. These three dances challenge the pianist to display both technical and expressive virtuosity, which Clare did to the full; bringing the programme to a breath-taking and satisfying conclusion.</p><br>

<p>That was not quite the end of the evening’s music making. Following the encouragement given to her by the audience’s enthusiastic applause, Clare added to the pleasure of the occasion by playing a short, nostalgic piece by a young, local composer, Michael Betteridge, who happened to be present in the audience. Quite an added bonus.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Clare Hammond worked wonders of restraint in the elaborate piano role' - <em>Martin Dreyer</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Now that we are (at least) less diffident about our own music, English programmes are becoming increasingly popular. The Goldfield [Ensemble], barely three years old as a group but of slightly riper years as individuals, are already specialists in this area. They appeared on Wednesday as a piano quintet.</p><br>
    <p>To the advertised Ireland, Bridge and Elgar, they added a zesty string trio by William Alwyn, written in 1959. Its four movements are uneven, but the central two benefitted from the Goldfield's rhythmic vitality and precise chording respectively. Elsewhere Alwyn's deliberate severity was never less than absorbing: his day will come.</p><br>
    <p>Bridge's Piano Quintet, completed in 1912, stands fascinatingly with one foot in its own century and one in the 19th. The Goldfield brought warmth and passion, not just to its skittish central scherzo, but to its three adagios, and engineered a smooth accumulation of tension in the finale.</p><br>
    <p>The whimsical changes in Ireland's Second Piano Trio reflect its origins in the First World War. Its brooding opening bars colour the whole piece. Such was the Goldfield's conviction that it emerged as a coherent set of variations. In contrast, Elgar's Piano Quintet is altogether sunnier, dating from the immediate post-First World War years. Here the group was especially alive to the spirit of dance. Clare Hammond worked wonders of restraint in the elaborate piano role. The Adagio might have been less leisurely, but its ending was properly sinister. The Goldfield is a group to watch.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'played faultlessly with the utmost clarity of execution - a breath-taking performance' - <em>Peter Schofield</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>On 11&12 November the Faculty of Music marked the sixtieth birthday ofRobert Saxton, since 1999 Professor of Composition and Tutorial Fellow of Worcester. A prolific composer of works written for many well-known ensembles, his song-cycle Time and the Seasons was commissioned by Oxford-Lieder and received its first performance to great acclaim at the recent Lieder Festival. The event comprised two concerts, ‘in conversation’ and a research colloquium. The Monday concert of Saxton’s music was given by Ensemble Isis, the other a piano recital by brilliant young pianist Clare Hammond, rapidly making her name as a virtuoso player.</p><br>
<p>The piano recital opened with Saxton’s latest composition, Hortus Musicae, com pleted this year, receiving its first performance on 24 June at the London Festival played by the same pianist. It is a large work in five movements representing various metaphysical aspects of ‘the garden’ – a sort of Anglicised Messiaen. Like that composer, the work makes tremendous demands on the performer. For me it was a complete revelation both of composer and of performer. The form is a sequence of short, impulsive detached notes interwoven with complex passages representing the mood of each movement. Hammond played faultlessly with the utmost clarity of execution – a breath-taking performance. She brought the same qualities to the rest of her programme – 21 year old Benjamin Britten’s Holiday Diary (Britten’s influence as an early mentor of Saxton is apparent), then Saxton’s Chacony for left hand, leading directly into Brahms’ transcription for piano left-hand of the Bach D minor Chaconne. The last, an interesting exercise, does not stand comparison in incisiveness with Busoni’s two handed version. At least the page turning was easier for a two-handed pianist.</p><br>
<p>We look forward both to hearing more of Saxton’s music and to Hammond’s next visit to Oxford to hear her in a more varied repertoire.</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'showed the delicacy as well as the power that Shostakovich needs' - <em>Simon Mundy, European Festivals Association</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'In mid-afternoon the deliciously intelligent pianist Clare Hammond started with a couple of Preludes and fugues by Shostakovich then followed it by Aquarelles in honour of Debussy by five different composers. With the exception of David Matthews (70 this year) none – although not young - were household names, even in the rarified circles of new music: James Francis Brown, Peter Fribbens, Alan Mills and Robin Walker. This little set of tributes to the relationship between Debussy’s music and water, however, was remarkably coherent in style and high quality. In many ways it was a throwback to the composite scores of the 17th century or the chamber music Fridays of Russian composers in 1890s St Petersburg. Next came a commission shared with the Royal Philharmonic Society (who have pedigree because they also commissioned Beethoven’s 9th Symphony) – a piece called Pearl by the definitely young Robert Peate and, to finish, Schubert’s D664 Piano Sonata.</p><br>
    <p>Clare Hammond’s brain as well as finger power was shown on the Saturday night too in Shostakovich’s Piano Quintet. It is such an immense work in every sense and so often succumbs to a performer's tendency to thrash their way through – what I’d describe as the Moscow banging school of playing. Here, though, Clare and the Badke Quartet showed the delicacy as well as the power that Shostakovich needs.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'In a later recital, Clare Hammond offered a piano odyssey, with pieces inspired by ancient Greece. Hammond's sensibilities were already apparent in Szymanowski's Métopes, Op. 29 and Satie's three Gnossiennes, but it was in the premiere of Kenneth Hesketh's Horae that she showed serious mettle. In Greek mythology there was a goddess for each hour, and this sequence of 12 pieces, a modern book of hours, builds to a very substantial 37 minutes. Hammond displayed its scintillating passagework and poetic calm with great flair.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'bringing the concert to a close with masterly panache' - <em>Frances Wilson</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'And so to Clare Hammond's solo piano works. Acclaimed for her musical intelligence, formidable technique and virtuoso flair, Hammond offered three contrasting works which amply demonstrated her ability to move seamlessly from the melodic gems inherent in Schubert’s writing, through Bach’s urbanity, to the raw energy and sensuousness of Ginastera. Bach’s Italian Concerto was replete with crisp articulation, tasteful pedaling and, in the opening movement, sensitive attention to the different textures of orchestral and solo keyboard writing. The middle movement felt improvisatory at times (despite Bach’s “written out” ornaments), an expressive treble line floating over the bass. The final movement was open-hearted, its bright theme streaming forth with clarity and wit.</p><br>
<p>The three Danzas Argentinas by Alberto Ginastera demonstrate the composer’s strong interest in the folk music of his country with their vernacular scales, strummed textures, and lively dance rhythms. The middle of the triptych, “Dance of the Beautiful Maiden”, was sensuous and sultry, while the first and the last were colourful and earthy, Hammond adeptly harnessing the full dynamic range of the Wigmore Steinway to striking effect, particularly in the final fff glissando of the “Dance of the Arrogant Cowboy”, bringing the concert to a close with masterly panache.</p><br>
<p>But for me, it was Schubert’s Sonata in A, D.664 (1819), popularly known as the “little” A major Sonata (to differentiate it from his more substantial work from 1828 in the same key) that really stole the show. The work is genial and expressive, its serenely expansive opening melody belying the more assertive and melancholy passages which follow. A tender middle movement is built around a single theme, while the finale has the lilt of the Ländler, with nods to Beeethoven in its textures, and a wistful mood. Clare brought to the work an intense intimacy, through highly expressive and beautifully judged cantabile playing, delicacy of touch, and sympathetic attention to the score, thereby highlighting all the subtle shifts and colours in Schubert’s writing, and reminding us, above, all, that Schubert was a composer of songs.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'perfectly poised and poetic phrasing' - <em>James Simister</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Clare Hammond's lunchtime piano recital began with one famous baroque work - JS Bach's Italian Concerto - and ended with Maurice Ravel's tribute to another great Baroque composer - Le Tombeau de Couperin. In between she played an eclectic selection of relatively modern pieces.</p><br>
    <p>Clare Hammond introduced each piece and described Bach's Italian Concerto as light and joyful, which applies equally to her playing of it. In her hands this harpsichord music sounds as if it might indeed have been written for the piano. Ed Hughes's Orchid No. 5 received its world premiere. Its melody had echoes of plainsong and its beautiful style is reminiscent of Debussy, though with more muscular rhythms.</p><br>
    <p>Alberto Ginastera wrote his Danzas Argentinas to celebrate the gaucho or cowboy as the epitome of Argentina. Clare played three of these evocative Dances - the Old Herdsman, the Beautiful Maiden and the Arrogant Cowboy, which calls for great virtuosity and ends with a spectacular up and down glissando that Clare brought off in brilliant but unfussy style. Kenneth Hesketh's Horae were written for Clare, who performed the last three of the twelve. Finally Clare played Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin with perfectly poised and poetic phrasing yet infused with a warm vitality; the audience's fulsome appreciation was rewarded with an encore - an Air by Handel - to end this memorable recital.'</p>

    <p>'Another winner who chose new music was Clare Hammond. Kenneth Hesketh's <em>Horae (pro clara)</em> is named for the twelve goddesses of Greek mythology who personified the hours between sunrise and sunset. Of the sequence of pieces written - as the title suggests - especially for her, Hammond played 'Auge' (daybreak) and 'Anatolia' (dawn). She found a crystalline beauty in the figurations of the former and brought out the latter's contrasts of colouring and texture with much flair. In the Scriabin, her phrasing of the wave-upon-wave of invention had the requisite sweep, and she captured too the frenetic, breathless, quality that marking of marking 'affanato' demands.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Hammond recalls both Myra Hess and Annie Fischer, great Beethoven pianists of bygone generations' - <em>Terry Blain</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Some pianists hammer the instrument into submission, some caress it. Clare Hammond is firmly in the latter category, as her inaugural recital as this year's artist-in-residence in the School of Creative Arts at Queen's University clearly demonstrates. Beethoven's 'Appassionata Sonata' - a piece frequently rendered virtually unlistenable by the clattering pyrotechnics it can unleash in players - benefits from Hammond's unusually judicious approach. There's no dashing towards the next climactic eruption in her interpretation, no overloading with angst, no drenching of the music in spurious, excessive emotions. Hammond focuses instead on the broader contours of the musical argument, unravelling the sonata structure of the opening movement with uncommon clarity.</p><br>
    <p>Beethoven's explosions of temperament, when they come, are all the more startling as a consequence. Hammond undoubtedly has the physical power to encompass fully the swirling technical difficulties of the tempestuous finale, but is again careful not to rush the music into fevered incoherency. In her judicious balancing of the classical and romantic elements in the sonata, and her finely honed musicality of approach, Hammond recalls both Myra Hess and Annie Fischer, great Beethoven pianists of bygone generations.</p><br>
    <p>Scriabin's Sonata No. 5 in F sharp poses interpretative conundrums not dissimilar to the 'Appassionata', its sudden lurches between what Hammond terms 'phrases of inexpressively sensuous languor and of frenetic activity' making it difficult to hold the single movement together as a coherent listening experience. Hammond managed this balancing out of contending sensibilities with an artless ease, gliding unobtrusively from interludes of heady, perfumed rhapsody to others of cascading hyper-intensity. So often in Scriabin there's an unwholesome whiff of hothouse decadence: Hammond purifies the air breathed by the music, distilling moments of exquisite, lingering poetry for the listener'.</p><br>
    <p>Earlier, in a nod towards her new Queen's connections, Hammond includes 'Piani, Latebre', a work by Piers Hellawell, Professor of Composition at the university. It's an immediately appealing composition, Hammond's elegant dispatch of the twinkling note-clusters in the 'Impromptu' section underlining how clean her attack is on the keys, how carefully calibrated the decay of sound in her scrupulously voiced chordings.</p><br>
    <p>There's also a world premiere, a brace of short works by Hillsborough composer and conductor Hamilton Harty, discovered recently among the papers of a woman Harty apparently fell in love with in 1934, during a voyage to Australia. The first, 'Portrait', distantly echoes the Elgar of 'Chanson de Matin', while the longer 'Spring Fantasy' has a Schumann-like turn of phrase and sentiment, with twirls of Chopin filigree in the piano writing. Hammond's accounts of both pieces are charming.<p><br>
    <p>Shorter works by Szymanowski and Messiaen fill out the programme, which opens with a ruminative account of Handel's 'Suite No. 6 in F sharp minor'. It's a work originally written for harpsichord, and Hammond doesn't quite manage, on a modern Steinway, to give the trills and decorations of the opening 'Prélude' the easy fluency of her playing later in the evening. The concluding 'Gigue', though, is full of élan and elasticity.</p><br>
    <p>The abiding impression left by Hammond in this recital is that she's far from bring a self-advertisingly virtuosic player, a strutter of stages on the international piano circuit. Her playing is of an altogether more thoughtful and discerning quality, focused constantly on the music itself, searching out its deeper significances and inner verities.</p><br>
    <p>Perhaps that's why the Harty Room is loath to let her go on this occasion - she plays two encores (a Handel 'Air' and Scriabin's 'Étude in C sharp minor'), but the audience seems ready to continue listening. They get another chance when Hammond returns to Queen's in February 2013 for more workshops in performance and composition, and a lunchtime recital on February 21. Piano-lovers who can get there on the day should certainly be attending.'</p>

    <p> 'Still, there are occasions when artist and programme really gel. One was Clare Hammond's recital, which married Giles Swayne's 2008 Three Bagatelles for solo piano with two of Julian Anderson's Piano Etudes, and also featured a little-known study by Stephen Oliver. Hammond, who studies at the Guildhall, played from memory with crisp precision and unflashy intelligence. The second of the Swayne pieces requires the softest, most even touch for its delicately balanced tonality to stabilise, just as the brittle humour of the third could easily snap under less clever fingers. Similarly, Anderson's studies require minute command, not just over each note's attack, but also of each release. Most impressive, though, was her natural sense of pacing, allowing the hollowed-out climax of Pour les Arpèges Composées to gather like a wisp of smoke in sunlight before dissipating in a passing breeze.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Her virtuosity was stunning' - <em>Ben Hogwood</em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'A fiery account of the Piano Sonata from Clare Hammond ended the first half, building on her performance of the same work at the Purcell Room in January during the PLG's week of new music and young performers. Once again she demonstrated a formidable technical command, as well as a strong affinity with the composer's quickly changing moods. A stern-faced first movement was darkly coloured, the mood lifting for a vivacious scherzo. Hammond performed the movements with as little break as possible, moving from the cold Passacaglia to the strident fugal subject of the finale with apparent ease. Her virtuosity was stunning at times, all the more so for being so dedicated to the composer's intentions.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'...unites unflawed elegance with the ability to gauge every work's emotional measure' - <em>Peter Palmer</em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p> 'So strongly does Clare Hammond identify herself with her composers that the music seemed to come from within her, rather than from the piano. This performer unites unflawed elegance with the ability to gauge every work's emotional measure. She opened with a selection of Schubert Impromptus, miniatures full of charm, but not all sweetness and light. Writing a century later, Olivier Messiaen liberally supplied those qualities in La Colombe (The Dove). This was effectively contrasted with Le Nombre Léger (Light Number) and a dramatically conceived Un Reflet dans le Vent (Reflection in the Wind). Alexander Scriabin's Sonate-Fantasie in G sharp minor lifted the poetry of a Chopin into mystical realms - realms which were charted with energetic conviction. The second half of the recital showed imaginative powers of a similar order. After an alfresco Bartok suite, Brahms' Two Rhapsodies (Opus 79) returned us to the Romantic mainstream. Vallée d'Obermann, from the "Swiss" volume of Liszt's Years of Pilgrimage, yielded an epic climax. The pianist's encore underlined the sheer agility of her mind and fingers.'</p>

    <p> 'And then came Clare Hammond. Her performance of Mozart's E flat piano quartet K493 was exemplary. She was absolutely confident from the very first, decisive notes of the Allegro, which she projected boldly, sacrificing none of its youthful joyfulness. There was lovely shaping of phrases... [and] in the slow movement, Miss Hammond's playing was expressive but always with a strong sense of direction. Here... there were some winning question and answer passages between soloist and strings and a genuine intensity developed towards the end of the movement which came all too soon. The concerto-like finale was pure delight. The pianist was in full command, her playing by turns lyrically elegant and masterfully assured. Clare Hammond has a bright future. My only regret was that we couldn't have Mozart's other piano quartet after the interval.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p> 'Rachmaninov's Paganini Rhapsody can suffer from over-exposure so there has to be something special about its performance to set the pulse racing. Luckily Clare Hammond had just the right combination of pianistic poetry and brilliance to make this a Rhapsody to remember. There was a jazzy, improvisatory feel about so much of it.'</p>
