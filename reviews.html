  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>“The city may have been segregated, but my taste in music wasn’t.” The American composer Philip Glass’s description of his childhood in Baltimore resonated sharply last week. He was in the UK to participate in concerts of his music and to celebrate the publication of his new memoir. Back in Maryland, the same night he was playing to a sell-out Barbican, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra gave a spontaneous free outdoor concert, conducted by their music director Marin Alsop, in response to the city’s current riots.The universal language of music “can transcend differences”, Alsop said on a news bulletin, surrounded by an audience of all colours and ages fanning themselves in the hot sun after a shot of upbeat Handel. A member of the orchestra was more sanguine. Music won’t stop riots, he acknowledged. But this event cheered people, made a change to the sound of sirens and, he added, got a million likes on Facebook.</p><br><p>US riots and a UK general election hardly equate, but with polling day imminent it is difficult to find any sign of collective political life in the musical fraternity. British classical musicians, whose relentless schedules leave little time or energy to spare, tend to be politically impassive compared with their rock music or theatre colleagues. An exception is the London Sinfonietta which, under the title “Notes to the New Government”, has commissioned 16 new songs to be premiered at the Southbank two days after the election. Composers include Kerry Andrew, Jason Yarde, Emily Hall and Colin Matthews. Topics range across the NHS, climate change, sex-trafficking and homelessness. Obligatory listening for the new arts minister? If only.</p><br><p>Glass, not so much a politician as a peace campaigner throughout his half-century career, has always preferred to see the bigger picture. This is true of his music too, where grand design matters more than close-up, tiny detail. It’s one reason why ears attuned to the dense complexities of modernism may struggle with his airy, forward-moving oscillations and repetitions. To be accurate, his comment quoted at the start was chiefly musical rather than social, reflecting on his one-world taste, from jazz to Cage to Indian raga via Bach and Chopin.</p><br><p>All these influences were audible in his 20 Etudes, performed by five players including the composer himself, in a single evening. They were written over a period of two decades beginning in 1994. As their name indicates, these are keyboard studies. Glass wanted to improve his own piano technique, whether scales and broken chords or trills and arpeggios. This was his chosen method. Some are mellifluous and dreamy, others stark, others ebullient. Chopin, Schumann, Bartók and Debussy head the long list of pianist-composers who wrote such studies.</p><br><p>While their works in this form may offer more harmonic variety, the Glass Etudes provided contrast in the act of performance itself. Each pianist was entirely different in style and interpretation. The young British rising star Clare Hammond was a dazzling athlete; Iceland’s Vikingur Olafsson a tender, oversized poet; New York composer-pianist Timo Andres brought muscularity and intellect; the Japanese Maki Namekawa, a long-time Glass interpreter, had a serene wisdom. In the four studies he played (1, 2, 16, 17), Glass himself was far more approximate, his fingerwork less than dexterous. Warmly received, he remains the admired grandfather-creator, gradually relinquishing his career as performer, still hard-working as a composer.</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Clare Hammond brilliantly caught the dark, Indian-flavoured moto perpetuo' - <em>Ivan Hewett</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'It feels sad to admit it, but the founding fathers of American musical minimalism are getting old. When they appear in person, the feelings that greet them are complicated. Last night it was the turn of 78-year-old Philip Glass, one of five pianists gathered at the Barbican to play all twenty of Glass’s piano Études, composed in twos and threes over the past twenty years. One felt a great surge of affection in the mostly young audience, tinged with a salute to Glass’s everlasting “coolness” and even a touch of reverence.</p><br>

<p>The programme note listed a production company and road manager among the credits, which might seem excessive for a simple piano concert, but Glass likes to stage manage everything down to the last detail. There were five individually-adjusted piano stools, whisked into place by stage hands. So each pianist was able to come on to the platform, play two Études and make way for the next, with smooth precision.</p><br>

<p>The music added to the sense of a well-oiled machine in motion. Again and again the familiar Glass fingerprints of endlessly repeated arpeggios and circling patterns came round. Occasionally hints of other composers could be heard, caught and held in Glass’s repeating patterns like a fly in amber. Schubert, Janáĉek, Chopin’s study in sixths, Scarlatti’s hectic repeated notes and even the "Good night" ensemble from Britten’s Peter Grimes all appeared.</p><br>

<p>The name Étude implies a technical exercise, and the pieces certainly posed a challenge. The five pianists had to sustain Glass’s relentless, wrist-breaking patterns with remorseless efficiency, while softening them just enough to make them appear musical. Unfortunately the one pianist who wasn’t up to it was Glass himself. The four Études he played were marred by lapses of concentration and an uncertain touch.</p><br>

<p>The other four pianists were superb, in their different ways. Clare Hammond brilliantly caught the dark, Indian-flavoured moto perpetuo of No 3. Timo Andres brought out the dry wit of No 9, which was a welcome change of tone. Maki Namekawa showed how even a weak piece like No 8 could be partly redeemed by gradually increasing the intensity of those endless mechanical repetitions. Best of the bunch was Icelandic pianist Vikingur Ólafsson. He played the blizzard of scales in No 13 with amazing virtuosity, and gave the still quietness of No 5 a monumental, rapt intensity. For a moment one had the sense of listening to a proper masterpiece.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'I sniff the air to see if I can smell smoke coming from the ivories' - <em>Thomas Hannan</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'In 1994, the legendary Philip Glass started writing the first instalments in a series of 20 compositions that would take him 19 years to complete. Wanting to improve his technical abilities as a piano player but having grown bored of playing other people’s music, he embarked on a series of études, a term for pieces that are deliberately extremely bloody difficult to play, and more commonly used as technical exercises practiced behind closed doors rather than for the pleasure of an audience.  Often, études aren’t designed for pleasure at all; they’re bafflingly complex, and – unsurprisingly in Glass’s case - highly repetitive, meant as mental and physical workouts for the benefit of the musicians rather than anyone else in earshot.</p><br>

If this all sounds pretty academic, that’s understandable. But what was remarkable about hearing all 20 of Glass’s Etudes performed together for the first time in London tonight (29th April) was quite how transcendentally involved each of the pianists seemed in their playing. The audience, too, spent the evening either in mesmerised, reverent silence or rapturous, tearful applause at the end of each piece, having witnessed a feat of musical accomplishment that seemed at once superhuman and primeval. Each one of the 20 études now takes up a place on the 20 most astonishing pieces of music for piano I have ever heard performed. I’ve never been to anything like this, and save for another performance of the études, it’s unlikely I’ll witness anything close in future either.</p><br>

<p>Walking toward the unamplified grand piano in the middle of  the Barbican stage to mass applause, Glass began the evening  performing  the first two of the Etudes, having admitted that – at age 78 – it’s now simply too difficult for  him to play all 20 of them in a night. What dexterity in his playing may have dwindled as he approaches his ninth decade is more than made up for in the palpable levels of personal involvement in the pieces; those who share the stage with him tonight might play faster or more complex music, but the privilege of watching the man who composed it lose himself in works that are decades old was unsurpassable (admit it; even in his 70s, the person you most want to watch do keepy uppies is Pelé).</p><br>

<p>There comes a stage in the evening where it seems that each pianist who steps up is the best I’ve ever heard at the instrument, until they’re knocked off their perch by whoever is following them, only to regain it in after the interval when each of them gets another go at a pair of études. The levels of technical skill and focus on display across these two hours cannot be stressed or praised highly enough. Timo Andres’s playing seems so intensely absorbed you wonder whether blood might start spurting from his temples. Maki Namekawa, wife of Dennis Russell Davies (whose 50th birthday gave rise to the first set of Etudes) plays with a reverence for the material that’s as emotionally draining as it is technically dazzling. Clare Hammond moves from jaunty, playful interpretations to sections so frantic I sniff the air to see if I can smell smoke coming from the ivories. And as for Vikingur Olafsson, suffice to say his playing was so superb that, at times, he had moments where he made even his bafflingly accomplished colleagues look like mere amateurs by comparison. But to be fair, that could be said for all of them. I can’t remember who played what, exactly. I don’t think I was necessarily meant to. I zoned out, because it felt more appropriate – and music rarely makes an offer to do so quite as enticing as this one.</p><br>

<p>Glass’ études and the performances they were given tonight stand as a timely reminder of just what heights humanity can reach when levels of technical ability and personal involvement in the music are both at their highest. Nothing about this felt stuffy, big headed, or contrived. It didn’t feel remotely “classical” - each performer’s personality shone through just as brightly as their technical chops. The études might not have been written for meditative purposes, but they serve it better than any other music of which I’m aware. Part of what made tonight so special was that it offered a reminder that there’s so, so much music in the world of which I’m completely ignorant, and it made me want to hear all of it, immediately.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… unfaltering bravura and conviction'<em> - Bryce Morrison</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Simply entitled ‘Etude’, Clare Hammond’s recital is gloriously deceptive. For here is no familiar programme of Chopin and Liszt but an enterprising and enthralling challenge for both pianist and listener. Opening with Nos 4, 5 and 6 from Lyapunov’s 12 Transcendental Etudes - a very Russian tribute to Liszt, Hammond then abruptly changes course with Unsuk Chin’s six Piano Etudes (1995-2003) and a world that is ‘abstract and remote’ yet ‘addressing the emotions and communicating joy and warmth’. Then follow Szymanowski’s 12 Op 33 Etudes (already a far cry from the Chopin-inspired earlier set of Op 4) and, finally, Kapustin’s Five Etudes in Different Intervals.</p><br><p>All this could set even the most intrepid virtuoso explorer (Marc-André Hamelin?) by the ears, yet Hammond’s musical intention is always paramount. She storms Lyapunov’s ‘Térek’ and ‘Tempête’ with full-blooded romanticism and finds all the sultry and romantic atmosphere of ‘Nuit d’été’. If Chin’s Etudes betray the influence of her teacher Ligeti, they are also highly individual and distinguished, their often playful quality ironically surfacing through a formidable intricacy. Memories of earlier work (the monstrous Second Sonata) flicker through Szymanowski’s Etudes as well as other composers’ (Scriabin’s double-note Study, Op. 8 No 11), while Kapustin recalls Debussy (‘Pour les octaves’ and ‘Pour les notes répétées’). More to the point, Hammond plays with unfaltering bravura and conviction, and she has been superbly recorded.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… this array of wizardry is not for the faint hearted'<em> - Jessica Duchen</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Here is a dazzling programme of 20th- and 21st-century Etudes from the young British pianist Clare Hammond, who would deserve many plaudits just for getting through this many notes. With its whirling kaleidoscopes of pianistic effects, this array of wizardry is not for the faint-hearted.</p><br><p>Part of its fascination is hearing the perspective added by the unusual progressions of repertoire; Unsuk Chin’s vividly imagined creations sound closer to the sensual coloration of Szymanowski than one might expect, while the many-layered voicing and driving rhythms of Kapustin’s irresistibly jazzy offerings find plenty of counterparts in the textural patterns of those more elusive soundworlds. The Chin work is especially welcome: the composer studied with Ligeti and seems to have followed him in creating a set of challenging studies that push the instrument’s capacities to the utmost.</p><br><p>It is a gloriously creative programme and Hammond pulls it off without succumbing to any temptations of overt ‘flashiness’ or bombastic technical showing off; instead she favours precision, clarity and seriousness of purpose. Yet I found myself wishing for the character of each composer to be even more strongly defined: we hear the similarities between them perhaps more strongly than the differences - for instance, Kapustin’s rhythms could dig deeper and feel more visceral. Voicing throughout could occasionally be more vividly set in perspective, since at times the focusing threads can seem subsumed into busy textures. Still, it is a terrific achievement and the repertoire is fresh and fantastic.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… imagination and bravura'<em> - Paul Driver</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>"Hammond explores the continuing concept of the piano étude with imagination and bravura. The 19th-century embodiment of the study, not just as technical training, but expressive daring, remained an inspiration for composers. She begins with three examples from Sergei Lyapunov, richly Romantic in figuration, dextrously unfolded here. Then comes the startling contrast of the thin treble attack of Chin’s post-tonal Six Etudes, the textural imagination as fascinating as the digital experiments are fiendish. Szymanowski’s 12 Studies are a return to sumptuousness; Kapustin’s Five Etudes in Different Intervals open the transcendental study to jazz."</p><br>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>"Etude CD Review - style and substance: The young British pianist Clare Hammond is fast building a reputation as a stylish interpreter of the new or less familiar. Until Chopin showed us otherwise, etudes tended to prompt thoughts of dreary studies designed to advance technique. Hammond challenges the assumption with this intriguing showcase. The Russian Sergei Lyapunov (1859-1924) took inspiration from Liszt in his Etudes d’exécution transcendante. Szymanowski (1882-1937) conjures tonalities and delicate colours closer to Debussy than to his fellow Pole, Chopin. The real interest is the set of six Etudes by Unsuk Chin (b1961), witty, angular, pointillistic, and the Five Etudes in Different Intervals, punchy and jazzy, by Nikolai Kapustin (b1937). Hammond brings precision and clarity to all."</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… präsentiert sich als ausgesprochene Virtuosin'<em> - Dr. Hartmut Lück</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Die in Deutschland noch unbekannte britische Pianistin Clare Hammond präsentiert sich auf ihrer hier vorliegenden zweiten CD (eine erste, beim gleichen Label, enthielt Werke von Andrzej Panufnik und dessen Tochter Roxanna Panufnik) als ausgesprochene Virtuosin. Das legt der Titel „Etude“ schon nahe, obwohl sie nicht die ursprünglichen, kompositorisch eher primitiven Etüden vorstellt, sondern aus der späteren Geschichte dieser Gattung solche Werke, die pianistisch-technische Problemstellungen mit einem kompositorisch-expressiven Anspruch verbinden. Dabei wandelt der russische Spätromantiker Sergej Ljapunov nicht nur mit dem Titel seiner Etüden, sondern auch mit dem klanglichen Ergebnis deutlich auf den Spuren Franz Liszts. Die dunkel getönten Stücke, denen Clare Hammond rhythmischen Drive verleiht, erweisen sich gleichwohl als durchaus reizvoll.</p><br>
<p>Die bisher erschienenen sechs Etüden (aus einem geplanten zwölfteiligen Zyklus) der in Berlin lebenden Koreanerin Unsuk Chin sind technisch intrikate Herausforderungen mit wechselnder poetisch-narrativer Charakteristik. Während in der Ersteinspielung des Werkes durch die Koreanerin Mei Yi Foo (Odradek Records 1700302) das poetisch-klangliche Moment mehr im Vordergrund stand, wählt Clare Hammond eine betont sportlich-virtuose Annäherung; ihre Wiedergabe ist meist auch etwas schneller, während bei den eher verhaltenen Passagen geringfügig die Spannung abfällt. Im Gegensatz zur Interpretin, die ihre CD selbst betextet hat, muß allerdings betont werden, dass der Hinweis auf Chins Lehrer György Ligeti hier nicht viel besagt: Während Ligeti bei seinen Klavieretüden eine vorwiegend mathematische Idee sich konsequent entwickeln läßt, steht bei Unsuk Chin doch die Auslotung des expressiven Potentials von Klang- und Registerwechseln an erster Stelle.</p><br>
<p>Auch bei den spätimpressionistischen Etüden von Karol Szymanowski und den jazzigen Stücken von Nikolaj Kapustin erweist sich Clare Hammond als souveräne Technikerin, die aber auch enormen Klangsinn zu entfalten in der Lage ist. Eine interessante und hörenswerte Zusammenstellung abseits der ausgewalzten Klavierpfade.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… exceptionelle finesse d'articulation, vitalité éloquente et force de conviction'<em> - Bertrand Boissard</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Après un disque consacré aux Panufnik père et fille ("Reflections", catalogue no 626), Clare Hammond propose un florilège d'études où les partitions centenaires de Liapounov et Szymanowski voisinent avec des pages écrites entre 1992 et 2003.</p><br>

    <p>Comme leur titre l'indique, les Etudes d'exécution transcendante de Liapounov suivent la voie tracée par Liszt. D'ailleurs, Nuit d'été - que la pianiste imprègne d'une belle finesse - rappelle les Harmonies du soir lisztiennes. L'interprète se tire bien de la haute virtuosité requise. Tout au plus pourra-t-on trouver les strepitosos de Terek un rien timides et Tempête, cet enfant monstrueux qu'auraient eu Chopin et Balakirev, moines tumultueuse que que sous les doigts de Scherbakov (Marco Polo). Bien troussées, tantôt acérées ou diaphanes, les Douze études op. 33 de Szymanowski évoquent souvent le Scriabine tardif, telle la deuxième écho de l'Etude op. 65 no. 1 du compositeur russe. Si Clare Hammond manque parfois d'aisance (Opus 33 No. 6) et doit d'incliner devant la clarté et le volontarisme de Martin Roscoe (Naxos), il faut saluer sa subtilité et la magnificence sonore.</p><br>
    
    <p>Changement de braquet avec les pages des compositeurs vivants, où la pianist britannique apparaît cette fois parfaitement à l'aise. Les remarquables études d'Unsuk Chin (née en 1961) s'apparentent à la traversée d'un miroir glacé (1), ou revêtent les habits d'une diabolique toccata (5) se souvenant de Ligeti - donc Chin a été l'élève - en ses rythmes asymétriques. L'exceptionnelle finesse d'articulation, la vitalité éloquente et la force de conviction de Clare Hammond - qui surclasse la version de Yejin Gil (Solstice) - rendent justice au travail d'orfèvre de la musicienne sud-coréenne.</p><br>

    <p>Brillantes et ludiques, jazzy ou évoquent un film muet en accéléré, les oeuvres de Nikolaï Kapustin (né en 1937) sont toujours payantes pour l'instrumentiste qui sait en dominer les embûches. La pianiste détaille le text et apporte une chaleur absente de la version rapide et virtuose de Marc-André Hamelin (Hyperion). En dépit de menues réserves, un disque revigorant.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… playing that is, by any standards, phenomenally good'<em> - Bruce Reader</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>"Clare Hammond opens her recital with three of Sergei Lyapunov's (1859-1924) 12 Études d'exécution transcendante, Op. 11. With No. 4, Térek Allegro impetuoso (1900), Clare Hammond immediately holds the attention as she builds the music from the depths, revealing a clarity despite Lyapunov’s dense textures. When the little, very Russian theme emerges each time, it is a lovely moment. She provides some especially fine playing as the étude develops. She brings expansive, languid, beautifully limpid delicate phrases and a fine touch to No. 5. Nuit d’été Lento ma non Troppo (1900) in a lovely performance, finely paced, allowing the music to rise naturally before a beautifully realised coda. Rippling volatility arrives in No. 6. Tempête Allegro agitato molto (1897) with lovely phrasing that enhances this pianist’s fine sense of individual line with a fine strength in the more dynamic passages.</p><br>

<p>Next Hammond gives us South Korean composer, Unsuk Chin’s (b.1961) Piano Études (1995-2003). Piano Étude No. 1, ‘In C’ reveals a composer who has taken the influences of modernist composers such as Ligeti with whom she studied, and formed a style that brings spectacularly fine structures, at times dissonantly melodic, yet always surprising to the ear. Messiaen also loosely comes to mind, yet this is wholly engaging, individual music brilliantly played.</p><br>

<p>Piano Étude No. 2, ‘Sequenzen’ rises up from the lower keyboard, gaining in tempo and dynamics until breaking out into an energetic, rhythmically complex passage. There is a more thoughtful passage before the energy returns with playing that is, by any standards, phenomenally good.</p><br>

<p>Piano Étude No. 3, ‘Scherzo ad libitum’ runs around in little phrases that at first appear fragmented but soon the ear catches a cohesion and structure. The music is playful in nature, something which this pianist picks up on, building to some terrific overlaying of lines before gently skipping to a conclusion.</p><br>

<p>Intricate little scales and motifs rush around in the Piano Étude No. 4, ‘Scalen’ with Hammond bringing an intoxicatingly fine, delicate touch to a brilliantly executed coda. With the Piano Étude No. 5, ‘Toccata’ little bouncing phrases slowly overlay each other leading the toccata forward before rising to a very fine coda. A terrific study, brilliantly played.</p><br>

<p>A certain fragmentation of motifs opens the Piano Étude No. 6, ‘Grains’, however, Chin cleverly develops the motifs, almost imperceptibly. Hammond’s fine ability to hold an overall structure allows this music to reveal the subtle forward movement, the little surges that overall give a propulsion as well as an arch like structure as it falls to the coda.</p><br>

<p>For those that listen with an open ear this is eminently approachable music. It is good that BIS have taken care over the times between tracks so that the right amount of silence is allowed.</p><br>

<p>Karol Szymanowski’s (1882-1937) 12 Studies, Op. 33 (1916) follow with No. 1. Presto moving off quickly with a subtle melody emerging out of the textures and some very fine terrific playing indeed. The exotic, scented harmonies of No. 2. Andantino soave are beautifully realised with beautifully coloured textures.</p><br>

<p>The brief No. 3. Vivace assai quickly builds to a fine coda before No. 4. Presto where Hammond’s fine delicacy is apparent, beautifully phrased, subtly coloured. There is an exquisitely wrought No. 5. Andante espressivo, full of nostalgia with rich broad phrases and a direct, forthright No. 6. Vivace.</p><br>

<p>No. 7. Allegro molto, with its little leaps and rhythmic changes is surprisingly modern in feel, relating somewhat to Unsuk Chin’s creations. A languid No.8 Lento assai mesto follows, atmospheric and thoughtful with Hammond bringing a lovely gentle, rhythmic lift to the music. No. 9. Animato brings more little rhythmic motifs before a rather brooding passage, Hammond revealing the fleeting character of the piece.</p><br>

<p>The turbulent No. 10. Presto has a subtle rubato and fine forward momentum before No. 11. Andante soave where again Szymanowski’s languid harmonies are finely brought out, the loose structure held perfectly. Finally No. 12. Presto, densely textured as the presto moves quickly forward, with this pianist maintaining a very fine clarity, subtly rising in stages to a fine coda.</p><br>

<p>The Russian composer Nikolai Kapustin (b.1937) brings jazz influences to his Five Études in different intervals, Op.68 (1992). No. 1. Allegro: Étude in minor seconds is terrific with a rollicking theme that has jazz, even rag time elements, brilliantly played and terrific fun.</p><br>

<p>No. 2. Allegro: Étude in fourths and fifths retains a similar feel but with a more serious vein. Clare Hammond holds the structure together brilliantly as the music varies in rhythm and tempi with overlaid musical lines. No. 3. Animato: Étude in thirds and sixths is another terrific piece with difficult rhythms and a lovely broad theme that momentarily appears out of the texture, not to mention a slight Latin feel.</p><br>

<p>Some terrific dissonances arrive with No. 4. Vivace: Étude in major seconds as the music hurtles ahead with sudden rhythm and tempo changes, Hammond picking up on the subtle rhythms brilliantly before leading to a more jazzy feel towards the end.</p><br>

<p>No. 5. Animato: Étude in octaves has a broader, freer feel with many different rhythms and flourishes wonderfully realised by Hammond who gives a phenomenally fine performance, bringing a fine breadth, flow and panache as the music leads to its almost Gershwinesque coda.</p><br>

<p>This is a first rate imaginative recital with some remarkable playing from Clare Hammond. She is very well recorded at Potton Hall, Suffolk, England.</p><br>

<p>There are excellent booklet notes by the pianist.</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… a fearless pianist'<em> - Nick Boston</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>"Clare Hammond is a fearless pianist, specialising in virtuosic repertoire from the 20th and 21st centuries, often championing the work of contemporary composers and premiering their work. She performed in a stunning lunchtime recital at the 2013 Brighton Festival. Her latest CD is ‘Étude’. It includes 26 études, a form which began as study exercises for pianists to develop a particular aspect of technique, but largely through the efforts of Chopin and other pianist-composers after him, has become an art form in itself, with composers exploring the outer limits of technique and pushing the pianist to new extremes of virtuosity. The disc begins with three from a set of twelve ‘Études d’exécution transcendante’ by Russian composer Sergei Lyapunov (1859-1924). This set was dedicated to Liszt, and completed the cycle which Liszt had begun of studies in all the 24 major & minor keys. Though whilst Liszt was clearly a major influence, this is undoubtedly music from the late Romantic Russian nationalistic school. With surging rivers (‘Térek’), an atmospheric ‘Nuit d’été’ and an full-on raging ‘Tempête’, the three chosen here give Hammond a perfect opportunity to set the scene for some barnstorming playing. The six Piano Études which follow are from South Korean composer Unsuk Chin (b.1961). Often thinner in texture, yet no doubt more technically demanding, these pieces manage to convey remarkable energy and imagination within the potentially restrictive demands of studies based on repetition or scales, and are probably the most pianistically challenging works on the disc. Hammond seems to relish the challenges set, yet also manages to find a sensitive touch in the delicate moments amid the fireworks. Polish composer Karol Szymanowski’s (1882-1937) set of 12 Studies live in the same soundworld in many ways as Debussy’s études, composed just one year earlier than Szymanowski’s (in 1915). These are short pieces, all under two minutes long, and Szymanowski does well to create a specific mood in such a short space of time, although there is perhaps less variety across the different études here, with the consistently bitonal harmonies creating an other-worldy feel throughout. The disc ends with Ukranian pianist/composer, Nikolai Kapustin’s (b.1937) Five Études in Different Intervals, providing the perfect closing sequence for this astonishing disc. Kapustin combines classical and jazz styles in a unique way, and here he takes a seemingly restrictive concept, a specific interval for each study, as a starting point for five exuberant and joyous confections, once again fiendishly challenging."</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>"The Etude (study) is particularly used by pianist composers to explore extended technique. The form has its origins in studies written to focus on a particular technique for students, but composers like Chopin and Liszt have provided a model for later generations showing how flexible and challenging the form can be.</p><br>

<p>On this new disc from pianist Clare Hammond on the BIS label, she takes the Etude into the 20th and 21st centuries, with studies by the Russian composer Sergei Lyapunov (1859 - 1924), Polish composer Karol Szymanowski (1882 - 1937), Russian composer Nicolai Kapustin (born 1937) and Korean composer Unsuk Chin (born 1961). It goes without saying that these pieces challenge the pianist's technique and in her article in the CD booklet Hammond talks of how the etude combines the visceral excitement of technical display with expressive, colouristic and compositional ingenuity.</p><br>

<p>She starts with three studies from Lyapunov's 12 Etudes d'execution transcendent. They are modelled on Liszt's transcendental studies but Lyapunov mixes in highly Russian colours influenced by his collecting of Russian folksongs. Etude IV: Terek (written in 1900) is named after a river which flows from Georgia into Russia. It is an impulsive piece, with cascades of notes and both delicate and bravura moments. Etude V: Nuit d'ete (written in 1900) is more lyrical and elaborate, but Lyapunov provides big romantic development. With Etude VI: Tempete (written 1897) we are back in bravura territory with robust yet romantic cascades of notes.</p><br>

<p>Unsuk Chin studied with Ligeti in Hamburg and her Piano Etudes (written 1995-2003) are successors to those by Ligeti. Unlike the other composers on the disc, though a proficient pianist Unsuk Chin does not compose at the keyboard. This means part of the challenge of her Etudes is the way they push the pianists technique. Inspired by electronic music, Unsuk Chin uses layers of repeated patterns. In fact, on first listening to the pieces I was struck by their familial link to the player piano studies of Conlon Nancarrow, though Nancarrow was writing for an automatic piano rather than a human player.</p><br>

<p>Etude I: in C introduces us to Unsuk Chin's sound world with open textures and a wide range, extending over the whole keyboard. The study is transparent, but quirky and though clearly fiendishly difficult, Hammond responds with clarity and bright textures. Etude II: Sequenzen starts with a low rumbling and gets faster and higher, creating an impulsive toccata-like structure which ranges over the whole piano. Etude III: Scherzo ad libitum darts and skitters about with Hammond creating pointillistic moments of colour. Etude IV: Scalen is full of light running figures, with Hammond producing a lovely crystalline textures. Frankly, it is difficult to believe that all this is created by just one pianist. Etude V: Toccata starts with a single sporadic line, which gathers fellows and the whole piece is full of repeated motifs which culminates wonderful climax. Etude VI: Grains is again pointillistic with random jabs and twinkles of sound.</p><br>

<p>With 12 Studies by Karel Szymanowski (written in 1916) we return to more traditional territory. He seems to have been influenced by Debussy's etudes which were written in 1915, and Szymanwski's main concerns are colour and light. Each etude develops a particular figuration, rather than focussing on a specific technical issue, and many are bitonal. The results are a wonderfully haunting and skittish sequence of short pieces. Each one a particular colour, with a general sense of a romantic, chromatic wash pervading the movements. Melodies are often quite expressionistic in style, and the use of bitonality creates a lovely aura of harmonic uncertainty. The group finishes with Etude 12: Presto which sees the hands chasing each other about the keyboard in madcap fashion.</p><br>

<p>Finally Hammond plays the Five Etudes in Different Intervals, Op.68 by Nikolai Kapustin (written in 1992). Kapustin trained as a pianist, but his style fuses classical and jazz elements. Though not a jazz composer, his technically challenging etudes include startlingly jazz-like elements. Each etude focusses on a particular interval so in Etude 1: Allegro the right hand plays almost exclusively in minor seconds (or the inversion, the major seventh). It is fast and chromatic, again with a Nancarrow-ish feel to the regularity of the motivic structures, but with jazz rhythms underlying as well. The whole feels, at times, like a demented boogie-woogie. Etude 2: Allegro concentrates on fourths and fifths, it is dark in texture but still busy with jazz and blues hints in the left hand. Etude 3: Animato is in sixths; this is a skittish movement with more transparent textures. Still very fast, Kapustin's wit comes out at the end. Etude 4: Vivace is in major second, is fast and intense with some fabulous jazz-rhythms coming out of the melee. Finally Etude 5: Animato is in octaves, the use of the octave in the right hand giving the piece a more open texture with Kapustin combining this with scalic figures. I enjoyed the Kapustin etudes very much, as he combines fiendish technique with a lovely exuberance and wit.</p><br>

<p>This is a stunning disc on many levels. Clare Hammond dazzles with the extended techniques which the various pieces demand, but she also creates highly musical structures. And the programme itself is a fascinating exploration of the way composers have used the etude to extend both pianistic and compositional techniques."</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'The piano study or ‘Étude’ has long engaged and challenged pianists, and the practice of writing etudes to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill or technique developed in the early 19th century alongside the growing popularity of the piano. Many of us will remember working on studies by the likes of Clementi and Czerny as young piano students. But it was Fryderyk Chopin who elevated the student study into a work of great artistry and beauty, turning humble exercises into glittering concert pieces, and his Opp. 10 and 25 Études remain amongst the most popular works written for piano. Other notable composers of Études were Liszt, Alkan, Rachmaninoff, and Debussy, and the practice of writing piano etudes has continued into the modern area with composers such as Ligeti, Cage and Kapustin.</p><br>

<p>On her new disc for BIS, British pianist Clare Hammond explores the Étude in works by Lyapunov, Szymanowski, Kapustin and Chin, a truly international line up of composers (Russia, Poland and South Korea). The imaginative programme combines some of the most electrifying and adventurous piano works of the 20th and 21st centuries, ranging from the impassioned late-Romanticism of Sergei Lyapunov to the jazz-inspired rhythms of Nicolai Kapustin and the mercurial, post-Debussyan soundworld of Unsuk Chin. For Clare Hammond the choice of works on this disc represents some of the most innovative, invigorating and imaginative writing for piano and  the opportunity to explore what the piano is truly capable of. All the Études on the disc fulfil the traditional criteria of the Étude (in the Chopinesque sense) of a piece which combines the excitement of technical and virtuosic display with expression, colour and compositional inventiveness.</p><br>

<p>This disc is not only a showcase for the variety and ingenuity of these composers,  but also a fine vehicle for Clare Hammond to demonstrate a sparkling technical sure-footedness, clarity of touch and musical sensitivity (particularly in the Études by Chin, which are, by Clare’s own admission, extremely difficult). The works by Chin are more closely aligned to Clare’s particular interest in lesser-known and contemporary piano repertoire, for which she has received much praise, and these virtuosic and playful études skip and dance across the keyboard with wit, colour and vitality.</p><br>

<p>Clare brings a richness to the works by Lyapunov with which the disc begins. They recall the soundworld of Rachmaninoff in their scale and textures, and are modelled directly on Liszt’s set of the same title (Études d’exécution transcendante).</p><br>

<p>Karol Szymanowski’s Twelve Etudes, Op 33 share Chin’s interest in pianistic colour, and are more closely related the Études of Debussy rather than his fellow countryman Chopin. Fleet and mercurial, Clare deftly captures their transitory moods and luminous colours, dancing rhythms and haunting sonorities, while handling their technical demands with aplomb.</p><br>

<p>Finally, Five Études in Different Intervals complete this fascinating survey of the enduring appeal of the piano etude. Composed by Nikolai Kapustin, they are characteristic of his output, fusing formal classical structures with idioms drawn from jazz, which Kapustin studied from the age of 16. Clare pulls them off with precision and wit, and an evident relish for this kind of writing for the piano.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… consistently energetic and brilliant'<em> - Blair Sanderson</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>"Clare Hammond's second audiophile release on BIS is simply titled Étude, though her program is a bit unexpected and quite exciting for its fresh material. Instead of playing the most familiar études in the piano repertoire, such as the sets by Chopin, Liszt, and Rachmaninov, Hammond explores the keyboard studies of Sergey Lyapunov, Unsuk Chin, Karol Szymanowski, and Nikolai Kapustin, which make fascinating listening for anyone venturing beyond the standard fare. While etudes are usually focused on the development of specific keyboard techniques, composers since the Romantic era have also infused them with strong moods and dramatic gestures, often treating them as character pieces or short tone poems. The three etudes from Lyapunov's set of 12 Études d'exécution transcendante are lush and atmospheric, and rather reminiscent of early Rachmaninov in their intense surges and rhythmic dynamism. By way of contrast, Chin's piano etudes are elaborate structures built on angular lines, short gestures, and pan-chromatic harmonies, employing the most complex of modern piano techniques. Szymanowski's set of 12 Studies bridges the divide between Romantic and modern styles, yet shares a certain similarity to the etudes of another great pianist-composer on the stylistic cusp, Alexander Scriabin. Kapustin's jazzy Five Études in Different Intervals tackles the problem of executing parallel intervals, though the studies on minor seconds, major seconds, and fourths reflect their common use in modern harmony. Hammond's playing is consistently energetic and brilliant, and through it, she convincingly demonstrates that this body of work should be much better known."</p>

    <p></p><br>"Данный компакт-диск включает фортепианную музыку выдающегося польского композитора Анджея Пануфника и его дочери Роксаны Пануфник. Наряду с произведениями, написанными для рояля, здесь есть другие опусы в переложениях Роксаны Пануфник. Анджей Пануфник приступил к сочинению цикла 12 пьес «Квинтовый круг» («Klag kwintowy») в 1947 году после пятилетнего творческого застоя в годы войны (это время композитор провел в Варшаве). Миниатюрные штудии – каждая длится чуть больше минуты – располагаются по квинтовому кругу (отсюда название): тоники до диез, фа диез, си и т.д. Пьесы объединены одной темой, резко контрастируют друг с другом по темпу и динамике и оставляют ощущение узоров, неожиданно возникающих при поворотах трубки калейдоскопа. В основе вокализов для сопрано и рояля «Hommage à Chopin» лежат народные мелодии области Мазовия, где родился Шопен; на диске представлены три из пяти вокализов. Пятичастная «Пентасоната», увидевшая свет в год 70-летия композитора (1984), основана на пентатоновом звукоряде, обрамлена частями в пятидольных размерах (пента – пентатоника, пять частей, пять долей). В книге «Смысл и содержание моей музыки» Пануфник признается, что, работая над этим, как и над другими своими сочинениями, он стремился достичь «баланса между умом и сердцем, интеллектом и эмоциями». «Молитва» (1991) основана также на вокальном оригинале: двух произведениях для голоса и рояля на стихи Ежи Петркевича; Анджей Пануфник положил на музыку полностью только одно стихотворение, тогда как вторая пьеса представляет собой стихи, декламируемый под музыкальную версию второго стиха. «Отражения» (1968) наглядно показывают приверженность композитора зеркальным формам и музыкально-геометрическим орнаментам, служащим структурной основой большинства его сочинений. Наконец, на диске представлена пьеса «Второй дом» Роксаны Пануфник, которая представляет собой вариации на тему польской народной песни. Вся эта музыка в мастерском, вдохновенном, ярком и вместе с тем необыкновенно бережном исполнении превосходной пианистки Клэр Хэммонд оставляет впечатление чистоты, незамутненности, целомудрия и красоты, чему способствует великолепное звучание SACD-издания BIS. Думается, Анджею Пануфнику удавалось достигать вершинного для искусства вообще «баланса между умом и сердцем, интеллектом и эмоциями»."</p><br>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>"Andrzej Panufnik (1914-1991) was a Polish composer and conductor born in Warsaw. His father, Tomasz Panufnik, a violinmaker, and mother, Matylda Thonnes Panufnik, a noted violinist, pianist and composer, exposed him to music from an early age. In 1932, at the age of 17, he entered the Warsaw Conservatory to study at first percussion, later majoring in both theory and composition. After the completion of his degree, he travelled to Vienna to study conducting with Felix Weingartner, eventually following him, after the Anschluss, first to Paris, then London. But he returned to Warsaw during the war ywars, participating in the highly restricted musical life of the city, most notably performing with Lutosławski in duo-piano concerts. Many of his early works were destroyed, not due to  the war, but rather to a female tenant that had moved into his apartment when he left to care for his ailing mother - she saw the papers and assumed that they were all trash. His interest in various Modernist techniques caused him strife in the then Stalinist controlled Poland. In the mid-1950s, while on tour in Zurich, he made his move to escape his homeland, eventually settling in England and becoming a British citizen in 1961. It was not until 1990 that he returned to Poland, now a country with a democratically elected government. He was knighted in 1991.</p><br>
    <p>But this release features not only that composer's music, but also the music of Roxanna Panufnik, the composer's daughter. Born in London in 1968, Roxanna, too, had musical exposure from an early age, later studying at London's Royal Academy of Music. She has gone on to composer a wide range of compositions - opera, ballet, choral works, chamber music, music for film and television, and solo piano works - which are performed the world over. The current release features her original compositions, but also reworkings or arrangements of her father's works, originally for voice and piano, for solo piano.</p><br>
    <p>Andrzej Panufnik has three major works for solo piano. The 12 Miniature Studies (1947, rev. 1955/1964), which were initially called Circle of Fifths, is comprised of a series of études beginning in C sharp (Major / Minor) and successively moving down a fifth at a time, until finally reaching the key of G sharp, a fifth above the first; each étude shares a similar melodic line, so that interest in maintained through the contrast of tempo, dynamics, meter, and other musical aspects. Reflections (1968) was completed within days of the birth of Roxanna. It is, in the composer's own words, representative of "contemplation… and reflections in the tangible sense… based on constant reflections of a single triad with its perpetual transpositions used both vertically and horizontally." It is a sparse-sounding work, with an angular melodic line, and harmonic clusters reminiscent in sound of Bartók's night music. The Pentasonata (1984) is the composer's last work for piano, written in the composer's 70th year, and dedicated to his wife. The work predominantly uses a pentatonic scale, and is composed of five sections, the first and last of which use a meter of 5/8 or 5/4. The beginning and ending play with the meter creating fascinating rhythmic features, while the middle of the work is more slow and contemplative. It is a perfect example of the composer's will to "achieve a balance between heart and mind, intellect and emotion."</p><br>
    <p>The transcriptions of Modlitwa (1990/1999, arr. 2013), based on an unfinished song, and the three (of five) songs, set as a miniature suite here entitled Hommage à Chopin (1949/1955, arr. 2013), are both lyrical compositions, similar in feeling, and - besides the playfully quirky second of the Chopin settings - all meditative in nature. The original compositions of Roxanna Panufnik are comprised of two works here. Second Home (2003, rev. 2006) is, according to the pianist and booklet writer, "a series of variations on the Polish folk theme Hejne ino, fijołecki leśny! and expresses her sentiments for her father's Polish homeland." The second work, Glo, is short, a minute-and-a-half in length, and was written to commemorate the death of a family friend.</p><br>
    <p>Throughout this recital Clare Hammond proves to be a very fine advocate of this music. Her interpretations match the goal of the composer: Not only are they well thought out and intellectually stimulating, but also energetic, emotionally moving, and full of a whole spectrum of colours - in a word, bracing. Recorded in excellent SACD sound, particularly luminous, and with well written and informative program notes, this is a release that everyone should own. Buy it. You'll enjoy it for years to come."</p><br>

    <p></p><br>'The BIS Recording brings together some outstanding piano music by Panufnik senior, stunningly performed by Clare Hammond, and recent work by his daughter as well as a couple of ‘retrospective collaborations’, including a solo piano version of the Modlitwa heard on the Signum disc. Andrzej’s dazzling skill and imagination is immediately apparent in the wonderful Twelve Miniature Studies (1947, rev 1955/64) that opens the recital. Why this 20-minute set, full of invention, beauty and excitement, is not in the repertoire of more pianists is a mystery.</p><br><p>Hommage à Chopin is an arrangement by Roxanna of three of Andrzej’s five vocalises of that name for solo piano, and they are truly haunting, as is the transcription of Modlitwa. The late Pentasonata is relatively well known but a performance as vivacious and, at the same time, as attentive to detail as Hammond’s makes one listen to it as though for the first time - BIS’s superb production also plays a part in this.</p><br> <p>Reflections, from 1968, is grittier but the musical and philosophical preoccupations are essentially the same, and Hammond is as convincing in the earlier style as in the later. Between these two works come Roxanna’s Second Home and Glo. The way Hammond plays the opening repeated notes of Second Home would alone be worth the price of the disc.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Best known for his big orchestral works, Andrzej Panufnik had a mixed relationship with the piano. Though he failed a piano entrance exam at the Warsaw Conservatoire, Panufnik survived the war as a café pianist, and one of his first works when he was able to resume composition was written at the keyboard and eventually published as the 12 Miniature Studies. Premiered in Kraków in 1948 and based on the circle of fifths, they already show his preoccupation with patterns and symmetry. Most last less than a minute, yet they are strongly contrasted and prove arresting in Clare Hammond’s commandingly virtuosic performance.</p><br><p>Geometric forms also inspired Panufnik’s other two works for solo piano, Reflections - composed in 1968 at the time of his daughter Roxanna’s birth and premiered five years later by John Ogdon - and the Pentasonata. Roxanna is represented here as both an arranger of her father’s music and as a composer in her own right. Her first piano piece, Second Homa, weaves variations around a haunting Polish folk tune in satisfyingly scrunchy harmonies, adding variety to Hammond’s imaginative performance.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Released to mark the centenary of the birth of Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik, this disc is the first recording to present the works of both Andrzej and his daughter Roxanna side by side. The Panufniks have found a worthy champion in Clare Hammond, whose intelligent performances balance emotional reserve with witty characterisation. The collection includes four world premiere recordings: Hommage à Chopin (written by Andrzej in 1949/55 and arranged by Roxanna in 2013); Glo; Second Home (both by Roxanna); and Modlitwa (penned by father and daughter as co-composers). Hammond, who has worked closely with Roxanna, captures both the brilliance and the brooding in these works. Modlitwa (‘Prayer’, 1990/99, arr 2013), was originally written for voice and keyboard; its sparse textures use mainly the middle to upper registers, creating an ethereal quality. Second Home is Roxanna’s first piece for piano. A set of variations on a Polish folk theme, it is curiously evocative, with ample use of the pedal. A fascinating compendium, expertly executed.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… performs with authority and great imagination'<em> - Haskins</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'I believe this is all of Andrzej Panufnik's (1914-91) piano works. The two most extensive ones - Reflections (1968) and Pentasonata (1984) - have been performed previously by Raymond Clarke on Divine Arts and enthusiastically reviewed by Mr Sullivan (Mar / Apr 2003). This release also includes the 12 Miniature Studies (1947, rev. 1955 & 1964) along with two other works, Hommage à Chopin (1949 & 1955, arr. 2013) and Prayer (1990 & 1999, arr. 2013), arranged or with newly composed additions by the composer's daughter, Roxanna.</p><br>
	<p>Though Panufnik is known principally as an orchestral composer, his piano music shows a sensitive and masterly understanding of the instrument's tonal resources as well as a variety of playing styles and textures, deftly illustrated in the brief but compelling Studies. The idiom is dissonant, but with conventional phrasing and, from time to time, a suggestion of a kind of tonal hierarchy.</p><br>
	<p>Clare Hammond, who was a central figure in the Panufnik centenary of 2014, performs with authority and great imagination. She includes two works by Roxanna, Second Home (2003, rev. 2006) and Glo (2002): the former, her first work for piano, is a series of arresting variations on a Polish folk song; it is by turns lyrical and richly chordal. Glo is a short work written in memory of a friend who died of cancer. The BIS sound is, as usual, stunning'.</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'On connaît Andrzej Panufnik pour ses oeuvres orchestrales (cf. le vaste cycle entrepris depuis plusieurs années par Lukasz Borowicz chez CPO, cf. infra). Il fut l'ami de Lutoslawski, son aîné d'un an, avec qui il donna des concerts clandestins durant l'occupation nazie de la Pologne, puis s'exila à Londres, menant une double carrière de compositeur et de chef.</p><br>

<p>Son catalogue pour piano tient en trois oeuvres. Les Douze études miniature de 1947 (révisées entre 1955 et 1964) s'organisent en miroir, faisant alterner tempos et dynamiques. Nervosité ludique (no. 3), dépouillement (no. 4), sérénité parfaitement communicative (no. 10), violence sardonique d'aigus effilés, basses traitées en mélodie flamboyante (no. 5), accélération fantastique (no. 12): autant de révélations, dignes d'enrichir le répertoire des virtuoses.</p><br>

<p>A l'autre bout de la vie créatrice de Panufnik trône la Pentasonata (1984), d'un accès moins immédiat. A partir d'une construction en palindrome, le compositeur a essayé de "parvenir à un équilibre entre coeur et esprit, intellect et émotion". Elle se clôt comme elle avait commencé, animée d'une vive impatience, tranchant ainsi avec l'hermétisme de sa partie centrale. Le sens du contraste innerve également les austères Reflections de 1968, créées par John Ogdon, dont les accords dissonants et éruptifs font suite à une atmosphère quelque peu désincarnée.</p><br>

<p>Hormis deux pages de Roxanna Panufnik, dans la continuité de celles de son père (telle l'introduction méditative de Second Home), le disque propose des arrangements de mélodies. Le beau triptyque intitulé Hommage à Chopin dévoile successivement un faisceau de sentiments ambigus, un pantin désarticulé, sorte de Pétrouchka de fantaisie, puis un paysage qu'on dirait moyenâgeux, dessiné au moyen de riches accords. Avec Prière (Modlitwa), Panufnik achevait sa quête d'une simplicité et d'une pureté quasi religieuses.</p><br>

<p>Clare Hammond, indéniablement habitée pas son sujet, excelle à installer dans chaque pièce une ambiance.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… mit klug und spontan wirkendem'<em> - Peter Cossé</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Der polnische Komponist Andrzej Panufnik (1914 – 1991) ist kein Unbekannter, er ist aber auch nicht wirklich bekannt. In diesem einerseits positiven, im Allgemeinen aber für den Betroffenen und sein Schaffen unliebsamen Spannungsverhältnis steht auch der aus Warschau stammende Sohn eines Saiteninstrumentenbauers und einer „talentierten Geigerin , Pianistin und Komponistin englischer Abstammung“. Panufnik überlebte die furchtbare Zeit der deutschen Besatzung, engagierte sich mit seinem Freund Witold Lutoslawski im Widerstand. Mit Untergrundkonzerten sammelten sie Geld für die Kämpfer und natürlich auch für jüdische Künstler. Vier Widerstandslieder aus dem Untergrund zeugen von diesen lebensgefährlichen Initiativen auch in kompositorischer Hinsicht.</p><br>

<p>Der englischen Pianistin Clare Hammond ist es zu danken, sich um die Klavierwerke Panufniks nicht nur im Umkreis seines 100. Geburtstags angemessen zu kümmern, sondern mit klug und spontan wirkendem, technisch wendigen Einsatz auch dessen Ausdrucksradius überzeugend abbilden zu können. Die Zwölf Miniatur-Etüden von 1947, die 1955 und 1964 überarbeitet wurden, stehen nicht nur am Anfang der gewählten Werkfolge, sie sind aus meiner Sicht – zumindest im Bereich dieser Zusammenstellung – von zentraler Bedeutung. Dieses Miniaturen-Dutzend entwarf Panufnik nach einer fünfjährigen Schaffenspause unter traditionellen Gesichtspunkten der Tonartenbeziehungen. Die erste Etüde steht in Cis (Dur/moll), die zweite in der Unterquinte Fis, die dritte in H und so fort. Folglich sollte diese Sammlung auch „Quintenzirkel“ heißen, Panufnik entschied sich aber für die Etüden-Bezeichnung. Die kleinen, sich allenfalls nach der 3 Minuten-Decke reckenden Stücke sind – soweit ich das ohne Kenntnis der Noten zu beurteilen wage – von einem durchschnittlichen Schwierigkeitsgrad, der dem versierten Dilettanten reichlich Probleme bringt, einem im Umgang mit „heutiger“ Musik geübten professionellen Spieler aber kaum den Schweiß auf die Finger treibt.</p><br>

<p>Originell ist nicht nur die tonartliche Anordnung der 12 Bonsai-Übungen, sondern ihr dynamisches Kontrastprogramm. Einem „ Sempre fortissimo…“ folgt jeweils ein „Sempre pianissimo…“, wobei die geforderten Dauerlaut- und leisestärken durch eine weitere Vortragsbezeichnung ergänzt werden. Die vollständige Durchführungsanweisung lautet so zum Beispiel:für die Etüde Nummer 5: „Sempre fortissimo e molto agitato“. Allein die Finaletüde Nr. 12 gibt sich etwas biegsamer und damit weniger stabil im Ausdruck. In diesem Fall wird an die Vortragende appelliert, „ Pianissimo e crescendo poco a poco il fortissimo“ vorzugehen, wobei dem Hörer wohl klar werden sollte, dass Panufnik hier die Summe aus all dem Geübten und Gelernten zu ziehen wünscht.</p><br>

<p>Diese Miniaturen sind mit Gewinn zu hören, sind abwechslungsreich nicht nur wegen ihrer konträren Ausgangsstellung, sondern auch von der technischen wie motivischen Erfindung her. Wer sich mit ihnen beschäftigt, so meine ich, der vergeudet keine Zeit. Problematischer verhält es sich mit den anderen hier eingespielten Stücken der Jahre 1968 (Refelctions) und 1984, einer Pentasonata von 13 Minuten sich etwas lauwarm anfühlender Spieldauer. Hier wird deutlich, wie viel prägender und damit einprägsamer die Werke Lutoslawskis oder auch Pendereckis waren und bis zum heutigen Tag auch geblieben sind.</p><br>

<p>Mit von der CD-Partie ist auch Andrzej Panufniks Tochter Roxanna, die sich hier auf milde Weise schöpferisch, in handwerklicher Diskretion auch nachschöpferisch in Stellung bringt. Von den fünf Vocalises für Sopran und Klavier hat sie die Nummern 1, 4 und 5 als nun rein klavieristische „Hommage à Chopin“ arrangiert. Ein spätes Liedgebet ihres Vaters (Modlitwa) hat sie vollendet und 2013 für Klavier solo umgestaltet. Und schließlich spielt Clare Hammond auch noch zwei Originalkompositionen der Panufnik-Tochter – eine artige Zu- und Beigabe zur Vervollständigung eines Familienporträts, nicht mehr, aber auch nicht weniger…</p><br>

<p>Wer sich etwas eingehender mit der Persönlichkeit Andrzej Panufniks befassen möchte, dem sei eine bei Naxos erschienene Zusammenstellung mit dem Polnischen Kammerorchester unter der Leitung von Smolij Mariusz empfohlern (8.570032). Sie enthält u.a. eine Altpolnische Suite für Streicher, ein Concerto in Modo antico und Fünf Stücke für Flöte und Streicher erneut mit dem Titel „Hommage à Chopin“.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… Clare Hammond's playing is superb'<em> - Remy Franck</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Während auf Schallplatte in letzter Zeit vor allem die Orchestermusik Andrzej Panufniks veröffentlicht wurde, widmet sich diese Produktion ausschließlich der Klaviermusik und bringt auch zwei Stücke der Tochter Roxanna Panufnik, ein von Vater und Tochter gemeinsam komponiertes Stück sowie ein Arrangement eines Ensemblestücks zu Gehör. Die Interpretin ist die junge britische Pianistin Clare Hammond, die damit eine wichtige Publikation in dem Jahr veröffentlicht, in dem die Musikwelt Panufniks 100. Geburtstag feiert.</p><br>

<p>Dass neben den 12 Miniaturen, der ‘Pentasonata’ und ‘Reflections’ noch andere Musik auf dem Programm steht, ist normal, denn Panufnik hat wirklich nur drei Werke für Soloklavier geschrieben. Die 12 Miniaturen entstanden 1947 und waren eines der ersten Werke nach dem Krieg. Es entstand noch in Polen, wo Panufnik wegen seiner Musik gemaßregelt wurde und einer strikten Kontrolle unterlag, die er schließlich nicht mehr ertrug. Er unternahm einen geglückten Fluchtversuch und ging nach England ins Exil, wo er bis zu seinem Tode im Jahre 1991 lebte.</p><br>

<p>Die Miniaturen sind, wie so viele von Panufniks Werken, nach geometrischen Mustern konstruiert, aber die Musik zeigt dieses Konstruierte nicht. Der Hörer erlebt sie vor allem als eine ungeheuer abwechslungsreiche, farblich sehr vielfältige Serie von kleinen Stücken, deren Kontraste Clare Hammond sehr gut zum Ausdruck bringt.</p><br>

<p>‘Hommage à Chopin’ ist ein Arrangement von Roxanna Panufnik einer Suite für Gesang und Klavier, die sich auf Volksmusik aus der Gegend stützt, wo Chopin geboren wurde.</p><br>

<p>Die ‘Pentasonata’ wurde 1984 komponiert. Das Werk ist bei aller intellektueller Kraft im Konzept immer aussagekräftig und streckenweise tief emotional.</p><br>

<p>‘Modlitwa’ ist ein zweistrophiges Gebet, von dem Andrzej Panufnik nur eine Strophe vertont hat. Die zweite wurde von seiner Tochter vertont, die das ganze Werk danach auch noch für Soloklavier arrangierte. Es ist eine schlichte, aber sehr reflektive Melodie, die gerade mit dem alleinigen Klavierklang sehr eloquent wird.</p><br>

<p>‘Reflections’, Panufniks zweites Klavierstück, entstand wenige Tage nach der Geburt Roxannas, technisch auf Reflexionen eines Dreiklangs aufgebaut, darüber hinaus aber auch eine Art Kontemplation.</p><br>

<p>‘Second Home’ von Roxanna Panufnik ist eine Variationsfolge über ein polnisches Volkslied, das kurze Stück ‘Glo’ ein ‘In memoriam’ für einen an Krebs verstorbenen Freund der Familie.</p><br>

<p>Der klangvolle Anschlag von Clare Hammond wird auch diesen Stücken bestens gerecht, und da die Tontechniker von BIS einmal mehr eine sehr gute Arbeit geleistet haben, hinterlässt die CD ein ganz positiven Eindruck.</p><br>

<p>In this mixed program with works by Andrzej Panufnik and his daughter Roxanna, Clare Hammonds playing is superb. The pianist has obviously assimilated this music so well that she can fully concentrate on the rhetoric and expressive elements and give the music a full-bodied sound.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Ein weniger bekannter Jubilar in diesem Jahr ist der polnische Komponist Andrzej Panufnik. Im Herbst feiert die Musikwelt seinen 100. Geburtstag. Ewa Kupiec beispielsweise hat sein fast vergessenes Klavierkonzert eingespielt. Die junge britische Pianistin Clare Hammond widmet sich dem Klavier-Solorepertoire. Auf der CD befinden sich zudem auch zwei Stücke der Tochter Roxana Panufnik, ein von Vater und Tochter gemeinsam komponiertes Stück sowie ein Arrangement eines Ensemblewerks. Die "12 Miniaturen" entstanden 1947 - in einer Zeit, in der Panufnik noch in Polen arbeitete. Später emigrierte er aufgrund der strengen kulturellen Kontrollen und Sanktionen nach England, wo er bis zu seinem Tod 1991 lebte. "In meiner Musik versuche ich stets die Balance zwischen Gefühl und Intellekt zu halten" so Panufnik. Sein Stück "Reflections" entstand 1968, kurz nach der Geburt der Tochter. Das zweistrophige Gebet "Modlitwa" komponierten Andrzej Panufnik und seine Tochter gemeinsam. Insbesondere "Second Home" und das kurze Stück "Glo" zeigen, wie sehr sich in seiner Musik schlichte Melodien und emotionaler Gehalt mit durchdachten Strukturen paaren. Viele Werke, darunter auch seine "Pentasonata", wurden nach geometrischen Mustern konstruiert, hörbar wird dies jedoch nicht. Die farbenreiche Vielfalt und vor allem die reichen Kontraste dieser Musik bringt Clare Hammond sehr schön zum Ausdruck. Eine gelungene Hommage an einen Komponisten, der hierzulande noch wenig bekannt ist.'</p><br>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'a deft performance… the playing throughout the disc is a joy'</em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>2014 marks the centenary of the birth of Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik. Born in Warsaw on 24 September 1914 to musical parents, Panufnik died in 1991 at the age of 77, by which time he was recognised as one of the most important Polish composers of his generation. Today he is remembered chiefly for his orchestral works (he was also an accomplished conductor, heading the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1957 to 1959), but this new disc from BIS concentrates on a smaller and lesser-known corner of his output: his piano music.</p><br>

<p>As pianist Clare Hammond points out in her illuminating booklet notes, Panufnik's three surviving works for piano intersect key moments of his life and musical development. Panufnik originally studied in Warsaw, then with the conductor Felix Weingartner in Vienna, Paris and London. At the outbreak of war, and against Weingartner's advice, he returned to Poland, where he took part in resistance activities and gave underground concerts. Immediately after the war, Panufnik played a key part in the rebuilding of musical life in Warsaw, re-establishing the Warsaw Philharmonic, conducting, and composing film music to support his family.</p><br>

<p>His Twelve Miniature Studies date from 1947: they are engaging but technically demanding works, all based on the same melodic line, each contrasting starkly with its predecessor in tempo and dynamics, and following the Circle of Fifths (their original title) from C sharp, through F sharp, all the way round to G sharp. Here they receive a deft performance from Clare Hammond, who charts their contrasting characters with great skill.</p><br>

<p>From 1948, life in Communist Poland became increasingly difficult for Panufnik, and in 1954, while conducting in Zurich, he managed to give his 'minders' the slip and flew to England, where he remained based for the rest of his life (he was knighted in 1991). While his music had been deemed too progressive in his homeland, in England it was felt by the musical establishment to be too conservative. Nevertheless, following his marriage to Camilla Jessel in 1963 he became increasingly productive. His next piano work, Reflections, was completed in spring 1968, just days after the birth of his daughter Roxanna. It is a contemplative work, whose gaunt mysticism seems to evoke the world of Messiaen's piano music, and it is performed here with great sensitivity and a hushed intensity.</p><br>

<p>Like Reflections, the music of the Pentasonata of 1984 bears witness to Panufnik's fascination with symmetrical patterns, 'seeking to achieve a balance between heart and mind, intellect and emotion'. It's a powerful piece from his 'late' period, and the title is an apt one, for the work is arranged palindromically in five sections, is based on the pentatonic scale, and its outer sections are cast in quintuple metre. Again, there are moments which come close to Messiaen, and this most ambitious of Panufnik's solo piano works receives a highly persuasive and commanding performance.</p><br>

<p>Roxanna Panufnik has also become a successful composer in her own right, and the two piano pieces included here are, like her father's, reflective and accessible while setting formidable technical challenges. Second Home (2003) is a set of variations on a Polish folk tune, but also has its jazzy moments, while Glo (2002) is more intimate, a memorial to a family friend.</p><br>

<p>The programme is completed by two arrangements by Roxanna of her father's music: Hommage à Chopin is a recent adaptation of three evocative vocalises dating from 1949, while Modlitwa ('Prayer') is a beautiful completion and arrangement of a song from 1990. The playing throughout the disc is a joy, and Hammond clearly knows her way around this music in intimate detail. This is an ideal opportunity to celebrate the Panufnik Centenary while exploring some of his less well known repertoire. Strongly recommended!</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'This is a father-and-daughter release of engaging piano music by Andrzej Panufnik (1914-91) and Roxanna Panufnik (born 1968). His Twelve Miniature Studies are superbly crafted and full of interest; Clare Hammond brings amazing dexterity and sensitivity to them. As she does to his 13-minute Pentasonata (1984) and the lightly shorter Reflections (1968); both make for intriguing listening whether the textures are complex or spare: here is a musical mind of individuality, one who left us something to search for beyond the notes while also ensuring outgoing and meaningful communication. Of Roxanna’s pieces, Second Home is a slow folksong-inspired piece with crunchy harmonies, and Glo is a touching memorial to a deceased friend. Other short pieces are included by Andrzej and remind of his Polish heritage, and are arranged or completed by Roxanna. This is a very welcome recital, played with the utmost dedication, and very well recorded.' (See the <a href="http://classicalear.co.uk/" target="_blank">Classical Ear</a> app online.)</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… exude warmth and authority'<em> - Graham Rickson</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Andrzej Panufnik managed to settle in Western Europe in the late 1930s but returned to his native Poland when war broke out, giving underground concerts with Lutosławski to raise funds for resistance workers. After a break of several years, he eased himself back into composition with a 1947 cycle of Twelve Miniature Studies for solo piano. They're fabulous, assured music, each study based on the same thematic material, descending in fifths until all the keys are covered. Panufnik can do thumping virtuosity, but the most affecting studies are the quieter, nocturnal ones – no 4 a rapt slice of Bartókian night music, the eighth a wistful folk-tinged elegy. Folk influences are more overt in piano transcriptions of three vocalises for soprano and piano, Panufnik's 1949 Hommage à Chopin, neatly arranged here by the composer's daughter Roxanna. The compositional processes are invariably sophisticated, but never intrude – Reflections, completed within days of Roxanna's birth in 1968, is built upon transpositions and reflections of a simple triad, and 1984's Pentasonata is built around five beat rhythms and the pentatonic scale.</p><br>

<p>Roxanna's own piano output compliments that of her father. Second Home's elegant, sophisticated variations on a Polish folk theme are followed by a tiny miniature composed in memory of a family friend. Modlitwa brings father and daughter together; Andrzej's prayer setting left unfinished, the text's second verse elaborated posthumously by Roxanna. This is a fascinating, rewarding recital; both composers' pieces recall and suggest the music of others – Bartók and Lutosławski the strongest influences – but they've very distinct, personal identities. Clare Hammond's performances exude warmth and authority, and her Steinway is impeccably recorded.'</p>

    <p></p><br>This (2014) is Andrzej Panufnik’s centenary year. The celebrations are set out in a well detailed website and reflected in the magnificent CPO orchestral series conducted by Lukasz Borowicz.

<p>The contrast between Old Testament fury and New Testament whispered prayer is often a feature of Panufnik’s orchestral works. Examples can be found in his glorious Sinfonia Elegiaca and the slightly more oblique Piano Concerto, both of which are being played at Symphony Hall by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra with Peter Donohoe on Panufnik’s birthday on 24 September 2014 (0121 345 0600). Those two works formed a large part of my initiation into Panufnik's world from a Radio 3 studio broadcast circa 1975 by Malcolm Binns with the composer conducting the BBC Scottish to mark the composer's 60th birthday. The Elegiaca still strikes me as one of his most unshakably potent works.</p><br>
 
<p>Those polar opposites of violent desperation and still calm are also at play — if that is the word — in the composer’s piano music. The Twelve Miniature Studies could easily have been academic. They turn out to be miniature and contrasted facets of the composer's personality. Taking a few examples: I: a breathless crystalline cascade of notes of such motoric drive you might almost imagine them as one of Conlon Nancarrow's pianola studies. II: a confiding introspection of the type by which the composer is known from his Sinfonia Sacra. IV: a hypnotically bluesy quiet tolling. V: a galloping angular 'blocky' rush. VIII: a dewy dream. XII: excitement released yet barely contained in a distorted reflection of the first of the studies.</p><br>
 
<p>Roxanna Panufnik - herself a composer of some eminence - first appears here as the arranger of three movements from her father’s Hommage á Chopin. This work we may know from its version for flute and strings (1949, rev. 1955) a recording of which has been reviewed here. This in turn began life as Five Vocalises for soprano and piano; I would like to hear that. These are no Chopin facsimiles – nothing like Silvestrov’s composer pastiches - but a genuine personal homage and of some moment. The final Andante for example is distinctively Panufnik: accessible but not facile.</p><br>
 
<p>The 12 minute Pentasonata is governed by the number five; indeed number and geometrical schemes are to be found at the heart of several of his works. It was the composer's stated aim in this work: ‘to achieve a balance between heart and mind, intellect and emotion’. Along the way in this his single largest continuously playing piece we encounter plangent Tippett-like bluesy pages, the fragmented shards of what feels like a nightmare, descents into taciturn silence and trailing strands. This is one of the composer's most overtly angular and modernistic works: a dark pilgrimage indeed. Like everything here it is thoughtfully and powerfully put across by Clare Hammond. Her engineer collaborators at Bis have done their usual handsome service at every professional, technical and presentational turn.</p><br>
 
<p>The joint father-daughter piece Modlitwa (Prayer) began as a work for voice and keyboard. It was arranged and completed by the daughter after her father’s death. It is a touching and unhurried piece – almost sentimental. It would play well in the company of PMD’s Farewell to Stromness. It is redolent of similar passages in the Heroic Overture and Sinfonia Sacra. A similar tolling, both imposing and smiling, runs at first through Roxanna Panufnik’s Second Home – a set of variations on the polish folk-theme Hejze ino, fijolecko lesny. This soon picks up a jazzy impulse which in turn fades quite magically into a slowly progressed reflection. Her very brief and slowly self-focused Glo was written in memory of a family friend who died of cancer.</p><br>
 
<p>We are told that Andrzej Panufnik’s Reflections, which was written shortly after the birth of Roxanna is testimony to the composer's life-long fascination with mirror forms and geometric patterns. It's typically calm, self-absorbed and mesmeric with its dark waters stirred from time to time. Its language is not far removed from that of the Miniature Studies but looks forward to the at times unforgivingly jagged contouring of the Pentasonata.</p><br>
 
<p>Clare Hammond provides the programme note complete with a diagrammatic representation of the Miniature Studies which began life as Circle of Fifths.</p><br>
 
<p>We should note that there is a Divine Art disc of the Miniature Studies, Pentasonata and Reflections by Raymond Clarke. It couples these three works with some Shostakovich and include neither the Chopin Homage nor the Roxanna Panufnik works.</p><br>
 
<p>A strong disc from Clare Hammond with genuine music that ranges from instantly gratifying to something more iron-clad requiring time and repetition.</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… enormous technical panache and total concentration' - <em>Stuart Millson</em><em></em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'New from the Swedish BIS label is a collection of Panufnik's piano music, from the <em>Twelve Miniature Studies</em> of 1947 (revised in the 1950s and '60s), the <em>Homage à Chopin</em> (arranged by the composer's daughter, Roxanna, whose work also appears on this CD - her piece of 2003, <em>Second Home</em>), and a collaboration between father and daughter, <em>Modlitwa</em> or 'Prayer'. The pianist, Clare Hammond, executes this repertoire with enormous technical panache and total concentration - as this emphatically 20th century music (sometimes, to my ears, in the manner of Bela Bartok) makes clear demands of both performer and listener, although a softer lyricism enters into the composer's Chopin homage. Clare Hammond was acclaimed by <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> as a soloist of "amazing power", and her name is well known to visitors to the Wigmore Hall and Kings Place in London. Panufnik's Twelve Miniatures must be close to her heart, for it seems as though this succession of short, instantaneous pieces becomes a much "greater" work in her hands. A fascinating and rewarding disc - BIS capturing the depths and detail of the Steinway Grand Piano with complete mastery.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> 'A gem of a disc' - <em>Robert Hugill</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'This year's centenary of the birth of Andrzej Panufnik has started to throw up some interesting disc of his music. For BIS Records, pianist Clare Hammond has recorded Panufnik's three major works for solo piano, Twelve Miniature Studies, Pentasonata and Reflections along with his daughter Roxanna Panufnik's arrangement of Andrzej Panufnik's Hommage a Chopin, Roxanna's completion of her father's Modlitwa and Roxanna's own Second Home and Glo. The results providing a satisfying compendium of Panufnik on piano.</p><br>

<p>Andrzej Panufnik's Twelve Miniature Studies were written in 1947 after Panufnik had had a five year break from serious creative work. Each of the twelve studies is based on the same melodic line, but constrasting with its predecessor in dynamic and tempo. So that the work opens with Sempre fortissimo e moto veloce, followed by Sempre pianissimo e molto legato. Additionally each study is a step further along the circle of fifths, so the the first one is in C sharp, the second in F sharp, the third in B, and so on until the final one is in G sharp. The faster movements are all brilliant runs, vigorous toccatas and nervous energy, whilst the softer ones are spare and more lyric. The result is a fascinating series of tiny character studies.</p><br>


<p>Written in 1949, Andrzej Panufnik's Hommage a Chopin was originally five vocalises for soprano and piano, with the material coming from folk-music from Mazowia, the central region of Poland where Chopin was born. Roxanna Panufnik has arranged three, nos. 1, 4 and 5 for piano solo. They are short pieces and, like the Twelve Miniature Studies, have the feeling of character studies; the first slow, steady and passacaglia-like, the second perky and sprightly with slower lyric moments, and the third gentle and lyric.</p><br>

<p>Andrzej Panufnik's Pentasonata was written in 1984, the year he was 70. It is based on the number five, there are five sections arranged palindromically, the material is based on the pentatonic scale, the outer sections are in quintuple time (one in 5/8 the other in 5/4). That said, the work flows naturally and emotionally with any feeling of contrivance that this design might imply. A dramatic, fast and rather expressionist opening leads to a quietly expressive section where Panufnik combines lyricism with a dissonant element in a typical way. The central section is full of dramatic rhetoric, almost like a dialogue, supported by astringent harmony. Sparer textures develop in intensity before something like the opening material returns.</p><br>

<p>Modlitwa was a setting by Andrzej Panufnik of a prayer by Jerzy Pietrikiewicz, but Andrzej Panufnik set only one verse leaving the second to be narrated. Roxanna has written a setting of the second verse and created a piano solo version of the work. The resulting combined effort it magically haunting with both father and daughter clearly fascinated by the combination of major and minor modes.</p><br>

<p>Roxanna Panufnik's Second Home was written in 2003 and is a series of variations on a Polish folk-theme, expressing Roxanna's feelings about her father's homeland. The theme starts simple and evocatively, and the variations explore the theme in a variety of textures and complexities before the simplicity of the opening returns.  Roxanna Panufnik's Glo was written in memory of a family friend who died. It is a tiny, austere and spare textured piece.</p><br>

<p>Andrzej Panufnik's Reflections, was his second piano piece written in 1968 within days of the birth of his daughter Roxanna. As the title suggests, the piece is based around Andrzej Panufnik's fascination for mirror forms and geometric patterns; Spare and austere textures, astringent harmonies and a lovely clarity of thought and texture.</p><br>

<p>The performances from pianist Clare Hammond are all exemplary, and she shows profound sympathy with both Andrzej Panufnik and Roxanna Panufnik's sound worlds. Hammond brings exemplary clarity and lyricism to the music, without neglecting the moments of drama. Hammond's own programme note introduces both composers and their work. A gem of a disc.'.</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer"> '… superbly played by British pianist Clare Hammond' - </em>REB<em></em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'"Reflections" is the title of a BIS SACD devoted to piano music of Andrzej Panufnik and his daughter Roxanna played by Clare Hammond. Panufnik (1914-1990), a leading Polish composer of the century, also was important as a conductor (he studied with Felix Weingartner), and played an important part in development of the Warsaw Philharmonic. He composed profusely, his works including 10 symphonies, chamber music, vocal music and for piano some of which is featured on this fine new disk, an appropriate tribute to the centenary of Panufnik's birth. We have his Twelve Miniature Studies, three of his five Hommage à Chopin originally written for soprano and piano here arranged by Roxanna for solo piano (none of them are Chopinesque), the Pentasonata composed in 1984, and Reflections written in 1968, that shows the composer's fascination with mirrors and reflections. Also included are two works by Roxanna, a major composer in her own right: Second Home and Glo, and Modlitwa (Prayer), another song and one of his last works, completed by Roxanna. All of this is intriguing listening, music not heard very often, superbly played by British pianist Clare Hammond, who specializes in contemporary music, and the audio is another example of BIS's superb engineering.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p></p><br>'Morning coffee concerts are popular social events, usually oversubscribed, where music also brings to life some of Ryedale’s most beautiful corners. Two recently have been further illuminated by talks given by composers introducing newly-commissioned works.</p><br>

<p>Deborah Pritchard spoke with passion about synaesthesia - her love-affair with colour as an inspiration in her music - and specifically how paintings by Hughie O’Donoghue animated her new Seven Halts on the Somme, written in close collaboration with Desbruslais’s deft trumpet.</p><br>

<p>Its poignant contrasts, without gimmickry, subtly subjugate the martial trumpet to an evocative, even remorseful role, frisky against angry piano in Sausage Valley, pensively elegiac in Flatiron Copse, high and muted over shimmering keyboard in Pozières: The Moulin. A moving commemoration, tinged with hope.</p><br>

<p>In complete contrast, Edwin Roxburgh’s new Pro Patria Mori used extended techniques in an ironic evocation of war’s other dimension, from reveille onwards. It was memorable for Hammond’s majestic pianism.'</p>

  <div class="listing-heading">PLANET HUGILL, Vale of Glamorgan Festival, May 2014</div>
  <div class="listing-trailer">'… captured the piece brilliantly and dazzled with the more bravura passages' - <em>Robert Hugill</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>Penarth Pier Pavilion is a relatively new venue, a stylish new concert venue having been created in Penarth Pier as part of the 2013 renovations of the pier on the esplanade at Penarth (near Cardiff). This year's Vale of Glamorgan Music Festival has been making good use of the venue. For the festival's final visit to Penarth Pier Pavilion, on May 17, pianist Clare Hammond performed a programme of contemporary music for solo piano. Her programme consisted of a highly varied selection of generally short works, some written specifically for Hammond, including music by John Tavener, Andrew Keeling, John Metcalf, Adam Gorb, Tarik O'Regan, Peter Fribbins, Alan Mills and Robin Walker.</p><br>

<p>Hammond started with John Tavener's tiny Zodiacs (1997). It opened with a simple bell-like motif which Tavener managed to imbue with his usual fascination. The middle section repeated the same motif, but at a far faster speed, creating a rather attractive moment, before the opening returned.</p><br>

<p>Composer Andrew Keeling has a varied background, working both in contemporary classical and in rock. His Coniunctio (2013) was written for Clare Hammond and was receiving its world premiere performance.</p><br>

<p>In the piece Keeling examined the alchemical ideas of the mystical union of King and Queen / Sol and Luna. To this end, Keeling took a piece of plainchant (A Solis Ortus Cardine) and subjected it to a variety of his own transformations, merging it with his own material. The work was in seven movements, each with their own alchemical point. But I have to confess that, from first off I failed to make Keeling's descriptions tie up with what I was hearing and that I simply sat back and let the music flow. Perhaps it might have been illuminating to hear the plainchant unadorned before the piece started?</p><br>

<p>After a dramatic start, the music remained highly characterful with some magical moments. The various movements caputured a series of moods, there was quite a romantic sensibility to it but toughness as well. There was also some terrific playing from Hammond, who captured the piece brilliantly and dazzled with the more bravura passages.</p><br>

<p>Endless Song (1999) by the festival's artistic director, John Metcalf, was a flowing and elegantly lyrical piece. The basic melodic idea was quite romantic in feel, and Metcalf proceeded to vary it endlessly, keeping a feeling of constant flowing onward. Endlessly fascinating though the piece was, Metcalf wisely avoided the big gesture and kept it to a refined sensibility.</p><br>

<p>Adam Gorb is the Head of Composition at the Royal Northern College of Music. Hammond premiered his Velocity last week, so that we heard the work's second performance. The work started as an interrupted toccata, with Hammond contributing some brilliant, crisp playing. As the work continued, and the pulse got even faster, the toccata ceased to be interrupted, and Hammond brought out quite a hard edge to the music, and she certainly dazzled with the sheer virtuosity of her playing.</p><br>

<p>Tarik O'Regan is one of the festival's featured composers this year. His Lines of Desire (2005) was a short, quite romantic piece which let the music flow where it wished to, with O'Regan bringing a naturally contemplative feel to the gradually evolving melodic ideas.</p><br>

<p>O'Regan's Three Piano Miniatures (1999) could hardly be different as each movement arose from the strict manipulation of the same tone-row. The results were surprisingly characterful and dramatic. Whilst not strictly melodic, the pieces were highly involving in terms of content and form.</p><br>

<p>In 2012 the Two Rivers Festival commissioned a group of piano pieces to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Debussy. Each of the five composers wrote a short piano piece which had a link to Debussy's music. Hammond played three of these Aquarelles (2012), L'extase de jets d'eau by Peter Fribbins, Narcissus by Alan Mills and Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep by Robin Walker. L'extase de jets d'eau had a busy, flowing yet transparent texture which rippled and flowed, as if we were hearing the music refracted through flowing water. Hidden deep in the texture was Debussy's song Clair de Lune. Narcissus evoked Debussy's Reflets dans l'eau and invoked the story of Narcissus. A calm, gently rippling texture was placed agains slower moving phrases above and below, as if we were seeing Narcissus and his reflection in the water. Finally Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep evoked La Mer but here depicting the North Sea. Starting with a dark rocking figure deep in the piano, the consistently moving, dark texture had distinct hints of Debussy with in. You sensed the sea growing as the music moved up the piano, flowing and dramatic until finally it all subsided.</p><br>

<p>Hammond's programme was an imaginative collection of shorter contemporary pieces for piano, each one played with character, style and not a little bravura, her stylish playing matched by a very stylish dress. There was a good audience who were certainly knowledgeable and appreciative.</p>

    <p>'But then the mood turned noticeably darker and more chilling with two of O'Regan's piano miniatures, played by the excellent Clare Hammond. The pieces were short, sharp and not a little disturbing, played with the power and panache that has earned Hammond a deservedly high reputation. She was equally commanding in Robin Walker's 'Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep', from Aquarelles. Sarah Dacey, a member of the critically-acclaimed vocal ensemble Juice, joined Hammond to sing O'Regan's 'My House, I Say' and a highly amusing and entertaining piece called 'Worry / Don't Worry'.</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'... held the audience enthralled all evening' - <em>Graham Marshall</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'One member of the audience was so taken with the dexterity displayed by Clare Hammond in the concert she gave for the Rochdale Music Society on Saturday, 22 February, that he went up to her at the end and asked her to show him her hands to prove that she had only ten fingers! Such was the technical brilliance of her performance, which had held the audience enthralled all evening.</p><br>

<p>Clare has made a special study of music written for the left hand only, and she demonstrated how effective such compositions can be by opening her programme with a finely judged performance of the arrangement for left hand only of a Chaconne in D minor by Bach made by Brahms.</p><br>

<p>The first of the works for two hands was a sequence of three of Mendelssohn’s Songs without Words, to which she brought delicate touches of feeling matching the composer’s charm and restrained passion and making the instrument sing.</p><br>

<p>The second was the early A major Sonata by Schubert, which she played with engaging lyrical warmth as befits music which, although it has moments of passion, is predominantly of a even tempered rather than argumentative kind.</p><br>

<p>After the interval came Mozart’s Variations on a Minuet by C. Fischer. Clare took up the composer’s invitation to join him in a journey of discovery, and made the members of the audience feel that they too were being privileged to experience the various delights uncovered as each of the twelve variations was unfolded.</p><br>

<p>The concert then took a leap into what might well have been regarded as the distant future in Mozart’s or even Mendelssohn’s time with the pieces called ‘Gnossiennes’ by the eccentric French composer, Eric Satie. Keeping the listener’s attention for the whole of this set of six pieces, played one after the other, is no mean feat for the performer, since they are all very slow and very similar both melodically and harmonically. That Clare managed to do this to the obvious delight of the audience was a tribute to her artistic sense of the spaced out time and motion underpinning Satie’s experimental technique.</p><br>

<p>Clare then worked her magic on Scriabin’s Prelude and Nocturne Op.9, two of the most romantic and endearing left hand only pieces in the repertory: intimate and restrained passion in the Prelude, arching melody and delicate Chopinesque brilliance in the Nocturne.</p><br>

<p>The concert ended with a masterful interpretation of Ginastera’s Danzas Argentinas. These three dances challenge the pianist to display both technical and expressive virtuosity, which Clare did to the full; bringing the programme to a breath-taking and satisfying conclusion.</p><br>

<p>That was not quite the end of the evening’s music making. Following the encouragement given to her by the audience’s enthusiastic applause, Clare added to the pleasure of the occasion by playing a short, nostalgic piece by a young, local composer, Michael Betteridge, who happened to be present in the audience. Quite an added bonus.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Clare Hammond worked wonders of restraint in the elaborate piano role' - <em>Martin Dreyer</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Now that we are (at least) less diffident about our own music, English programmes are becoming increasingly popular. The Goldfield [Ensemble], barely three years old as a group but of slightly riper years as individuals, are already specialists in this area. They appeared on Wednesday as a piano quintet.</p><br>
    <p>To the advertised Ireland, Bridge and Elgar, they added a zesty string trio by William Alwyn, written in 1959. Its four movements are uneven, but the central two benefitted from the Goldfield's rhythmic vitality and precise chording respectively. Elsewhere Alwyn's deliberate severity was never less than absorbing: his day will come.</p><br>
    <p>Bridge's Piano Quintet, completed in 1912, stands fascinatingly with one foot in its own century and one in the 19th. The Goldfield brought warmth and passion, not just to its skittish central scherzo, but to its three adagios, and engineered a smooth accumulation of tension in the finale.</p><br>
    <p>The whimsical changes in Ireland's Second Piano Trio reflect its origins in the First World War. Its brooding opening bars colour the whole piece. Such was the Goldfield's conviction that it emerged as a coherent set of variations. In contrast, Elgar's Piano Quintet is altogether sunnier, dating from the immediate post-First World War years. Here the group was especially alive to the spirit of dance. Clare Hammond worked wonders of restraint in the elaborate piano role. The Adagio might have been less leisurely, but its ending was properly sinister. The Goldfield is a group to watch.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>On 11&12 November the Faculty of Music marked the sixtieth birthday ofRobert Saxton, since 1999 Professor of Composition and Tutorial Fellow of Worcester. A prolific composer of works written for many well-known ensembles, his song-cycle Time and the Seasons was commissioned by Oxford-Lieder and received its first performance to great acclaim at the recent Lieder Festival. The event comprised two concerts, ‘in conversation’ and a research colloquium. The Monday concert of Saxton’s music was given by Ensemble Isis, the other a piano recital by brilliant young pianist Clare Hammond, rapidly making her name as a virtuoso player.</p><br>
<p>The piano recital opened with Saxton’s latest composition, Hortus Musicae, com pleted this year, receiving its first performance on 24 June at the London Festival played by the same pianist. It is a large work in five movements representing various metaphysical aspects of ‘the garden’ – a sort of Anglicised Messiaen. Like that composer, the work makes tremendous demands on the performer. For me it was a complete revelation both of composer and of performer. The form is a sequence of short, impulsive detached notes interwoven with complex passages representing the mood of each movement. Hammond played faultlessly with the utmost clarity of execution – a breath-taking performance. She brought the same qualities to the rest of her programme – 21 year old Benjamin Britten’s Holiday Diary (Britten’s influence as an early mentor of Saxton is apparent), then Saxton’s Chacony for left hand, leading directly into Brahms’ transcription for piano left-hand of the Bach D minor Chaconne. The last, an interesting exercise, does not stand comparison in incisiveness with Busoni’s two handed version. At least the page turning was easier for a two-handed pianist.</p><br>
<p>We look forward both to hearing more of Saxton’s music and to Hammond’s next visit to Oxford to hear her in a more varied repertoire.</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'In mid-afternoon the deliciously intelligent pianist Clare Hammond started with a couple of Preludes and fugues by Shostakovich then followed it by Aquarelles in honour of Debussy by five different composers. With the exception of David Matthews (70 this year) none – although not young - were household names, even in the rarified circles of new music: James Francis Brown, Peter Fribbens, Alan Mills and Robin Walker. This little set of tributes to the relationship between Debussy’s music and water, however, was remarkably coherent in style and high quality. In many ways it was a throwback to the composite scores of the 17th century or the chamber music Fridays of Russian composers in 1890s St Petersburg. Next came a commission shared with the Royal Philharmonic Society (who have pedigree because they also commissioned Beethoven’s 9th Symphony) – a piece called Pearl by the definitely young Robert Peate and, to finish, Schubert’s D664 Piano Sonata.</p><br>
    <p>Clare Hammond’s brain as well as finger power was shown on the Saturday night too in Shostakovich’s Piano Quintet. It is such an immense work in every sense and so often succumbs to a performer's tendency to thrash their way through – what I’d describe as the Moscow banging school of playing.

    <p>'In a later recital, Clare Hammond offered a piano odyssey, with pieces inspired by ancient Greece. Hammond's sensibilities were already apparent in Szymanowski's Métopes, Op. 29 and Satie's three Gnossiennes, but it was in the premiere of Kenneth Hesketh's Horae that she showed serious mettle. In Greek mythology there was a goddess for each hour, and this sequence of 12 pieces, a modern book of hours, builds to a very substantial 37 minutes. Hammond displayed its scintillating passagework and poetic calm with great flair.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'bringing the concert to a close with masterly panache' - <em>Frances Wilson</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'And so to Clare Hammond's solo piano works. Acclaimed for her musical intelligence, formidable technique and virtuoso flair, Hammond offered three contrasting works which amply demonstrated her ability to move seamlessly from the melodic gems inherent in Schubert’s writing, through Bach’s urbanity, to the raw energy and sensuousness of Ginastera. Bach’s Italian Concerto was replete with crisp articulation, tasteful pedaling and, in the opening movement, sensitive attention to the different textures of orchestral and solo keyboard writing. The middle movement felt improvisatory at times (despite Bach’s “written out” ornaments), an expressive treble line floating over the bass. The final movement was open-hearted, its bright theme streaming forth with clarity and wit.</p><br>
<p>The three Danzas Argentinas by Alberto Ginastera demonstrate the composer’s strong interest in the folk music of his country with their vernacular scales, strummed textures, and lively dance rhythms. The middle of the triptych, “Dance of the Beautiful Maiden”, was sensuous and sultry, while the first and the last were colourful and earthy, Hammond adeptly harnessing the full dynamic range of the Wigmore Steinway to striking effect, particularly in the final fff glissando of the “Dance of the Arrogant Cowboy”, bringing the concert to a close with masterly panache.</p><br>
<p>But for me, it was Schubert’s Sonata in A, D.664 (1819), popularly known as the “little” A major Sonata (to differentiate it from his more substantial work from 1828 in the same key) that really stole the show. The work is genial and expressive, its serenely expansive opening melody belying the more assertive and melancholy passages which follow. A tender middle movement is built around a single theme, while the finale has the lilt of the Ländler, with nods to Beeethoven in its textures, and a wistful mood. Clare brought to the work an intense intimacy, through highly expressive and beautifully judged cantabile playing, delicacy of touch, and sympathetic attention to the score, thereby highlighting all the subtle shifts and colours in Schubert’s writing, and reminding us, above, all, that Schubert was a composer of songs.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'perfectly poised and poetic phrasing' - <em>James Simister</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Clare Hammond's lunchtime piano recital began with one famous baroque work - JS Bach's Italian Concerto - and ended with Maurice Ravel's tribute to another great Baroque composer - Le Tombeau de Couperin. In between she played an eclectic selection of relatively modern pieces.</p><br>
    <p>Clare Hammond introduced each piece and described Bach's Italian Concerto as light and joyful, which applies equally to her playing of it. In her hands this harpsichord music sounds as if it might indeed have been written for the piano. Ed Hughes's Orchid No. 5 received its world premiere. Its melody had echoes of plainsong and its beautiful style is reminiscent of Debussy, though with more muscular rhythms.</p><br>
    <p>Alberto Ginastera wrote his Danzas Argentinas to celebrate the gaucho or cowboy as the epitome of Argentina. Clare played three of these evocative Dances - the Old Herdsman, the Beautiful Maiden and the Arrogant Cowboy, which calls for great virtuosity and ends with a spectacular up and down glissando that Clare brought off in brilliant but unfussy style. Kenneth Hesketh's Horae were written for Clare, who performed the last three of the twelve. Finally Clare played Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin with perfectly poised and poetic phrasing yet infused with a warm vitality; the audience's fulsome appreciation was rewarded with an encore - an Air by Handel - to end this memorable recital.'</p>

    <p>'Another winner who chose new music was Clare Hammond. Kenneth Hesketh's <em>Horae (pro clara)</em> is named for the twelve goddesses of Greek mythology who personified the hours between sunrise and sunset. Of the sequence of pieces written - as the title suggests - especially for her, Hammond played 'Auge' (daybreak) and 'Anatolia' (dawn). She found a crystalline beauty in the figurations of the former and brought out the latter's contrasts of colouring and texture with much flair. In the Scriabin, her phrasing of the wave-upon-wave of invention had the requisite sweep, and she captured too the frenetic, breathless, quality that marking of marking 'affanato' demands.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Hammond recalls both Myra Hess and Annie Fischer, great Beethoven pianists of bygone generations' - <em>Terry Blain</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Some pianists hammer the instrument into submission, some caress it. Clare Hammond is firmly in the latter category, as her inaugural recital as this year's artist-in-residence in the School of Creative Arts at Queen's University clearly demonstrates. Beethoven's 'Appassionata Sonata' - a piece frequently rendered virtually unlistenable by the clattering pyrotechnics it can unleash in players - benefits from Hammond's unusually judicious approach. There's no dashing towards the next climactic eruption in her interpretation, no overloading with angst, no drenching of the music in spurious, excessive emotions. Hammond focuses instead on the broader contours of the musical argument, unravelling the sonata structure of the opening movement with uncommon clarity.</p><br>
    <p>Beethoven's explosions of temperament, when they come, are all the more startling as a consequence. Hammond undoubtedly has the physical power to encompass fully the swirling technical difficulties of the tempestuous finale, but is again careful not to rush the music into fevered incoherency. In her judicious balancing of the classical and romantic elements in the sonata, and her finely honed musicality of approach, Hammond recalls both Myra Hess and Annie Fischer, great Beethoven pianists of bygone generations.</p><br>
    <p>Scriabin's Sonata No. 5 in F sharp poses interpretative conundrums not dissimilar to the 'Appassionata', its sudden lurches between what Hammond terms 'phrases of inexpressively sensuous languor and of frenetic activity' making it difficult to hold the single movement together as a coherent listening experience. Hammond managed this balancing out of contending sensibilities with an artless ease, gliding unobtrusively from interludes of heady, perfumed rhapsody to others of cascading hyper-intensity. So often in Scriabin there's an unwholesome whiff of hothouse decadence: Hammond purifies the air breathed by the music, distilling moments of exquisite, lingering poetry for the listener'.</p><br>
    <p>Earlier, in a nod towards her new Queen's connections, Hammond includes 'Piani, Latebre', a work by Piers Hellawell, Professor of Composition at the university. It's an immediately appealing composition, Hammond's elegant dispatch of the twinkling note-clusters in the 'Impromptu' section underlining how clean her attack is on the keys, how carefully calibrated the decay of sound in her scrupulously voiced chordings.</p><br>
    <p>There's also a world premiere, a brace of short works by Hillsborough composer and conductor Hamilton Harty, discovered recently among the papers of a woman Harty apparently fell in love with in 1934, during a voyage to Australia. The first, 'Portrait', distantly echoes the Elgar of 'Chanson de Matin', while the longer 'Spring Fantasy' has a Schumann-like turn of phrase and sentiment, with twirls of Chopin filigree in the piano writing. Hammond's accounts of both pieces are charming.<p><br>
    <p>Shorter works by Szymanowski and Messiaen fill out the programme, which opens with a ruminative account of Handel's 'Suite No. 6 in F sharp minor'. It's a work originally written for harpsichord, and Hammond doesn't quite manage, on a modern Steinway, to give the trills and decorations of the opening 'Prélude' the easy fluency of her playing later in the evening. The concluding 'Gigue', though, is full of élan and elasticity.</p><br>
    <p>The abiding impression left by Hammond in this recital is that she's far from bring a self-advertisingly virtuosic player, a strutter of stages on the international piano circuit. Her playing is of an altogether more thoughtful and discerning quality, focused constantly on the music itself, searching out its deeper significances and inner verities.</p><br>
    <p>Perhaps that's why the Harty Room is loath to let her go on this occasion - she plays two encores (a Handel 'Air' and Scriabin's 'Étude in C sharp minor'), but the audience seems ready to continue listening. They get another chance when Hammond returns to Queen's in February 2013 for more workshops in performance and composition, and a lunchtime recital on February 21. Piano-lovers who can get there on the day should certainly be attending.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p> 'Still, there are occasions when artist and programme really gel. One was Clare Hammond's recital, which married Giles Swayne's 2008 Three Bagatelles for solo piano with two of Julian Anderson's Piano Etudes, and also featured a little-known study by Stephen Oliver. Hammond, who studies at the Guildhall, played from memory with crisp precision and unflashy intelligence. The second of the Swayne pieces requires the softest, most even touch for its delicately balanced tonality to stabilise, just as the brittle humour of the third could easily snap under less clever fingers. Similarly, Anderson's studies require minute command, not just over each note's attack, but also of each release. Most impressive, though, was her natural sense of pacing, allowing the hollowed-out climax of Pour les Arpèges Composées to gather like a wisp of smoke in sunlight before dissipating in a passing breeze.'</p>

    <p>'A fiery account of the Piano Sonata from Clare Hammond ended the first half, building on her performance of the same work at the Purcell Room in January during the PLG's week of new music and young performers. Once again she demonstrated a formidable technical command, as well as a strong affinity with the composer's quickly changing moods. A stern-faced first movement was darkly coloured, the mood lifting for a vivacious scherzo. Hammond performed the movements with as little break as possible, moving from the cold Passacaglia to the strident fugal subject of the finale with apparent ease. Her virtuosity was stunning at times, all the more so for being so dedicated to the composer's intentions.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p> 'So strongly does Clare Hammond identify herself with her composers that the music seemed to come from within her, rather than from the piano. This performer unites unflawed elegance with the ability to gauge every work's emotional measure. She opened with a selection of Schubert Impromptus, miniatures full of charm, but not all sweetness and light. Writing a century later, Olivier Messiaen liberally supplied those qualities in La Colombe (The Dove). This was effectively contrasted with Le Nombre Léger (Light Number) and a dramatically conceived Un Reflet dans le Vent (Reflection in the Wind). Alexander Scriabin's Sonate-Fantasie in G sharp minor lifted the poetry of a Chopin into mystical realms - realms which were charted with energetic conviction. The second half of the recital showed imaginative powers of a similar order. After an alfresco Bartok suite, Brahms' Two Rhapsodies (Opus 79) returned us to the Romantic mainstream. Vallée d'Obermann, from the "Swiss" volume of Liszt's Years of Pilgrimage, yielded an epic climax. The pianist's encore underlined the sheer agility of her mind and fingers.'</p>
