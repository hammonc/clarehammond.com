  <div class="listing-trailer">'displayed its scintillating passagework and poetic calm with great flair' - <em>Rian Evans</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'In a later recital, Clare Hammond offered a piano odyssey, with pieces inspired by ancient Greece. Hammond's sensibilities were already apparent in Szymanowski's Métopes, Op. 29 and Satie's three Gnossiennes, but it was in the premiere of Kenneth Hesketh's Horae that she showed serious mettle. In Greek mythology there was a goddess for each hour, and this sequence of 12 pieces, a modern book of hours, builds to a very substantial 37 minutes. Hammond displayed its scintillating passagework and poetic calm with great flair.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'bringing the concert to a close with masterly panache' - <em>Frances Wilson</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'And so to Clare Hammond's solo piano works. Acclaimed for her musical intelligence, formidable technique and virtuoso flair, Hammond offered three contrasting works which amply demonstrated her ability to move seamlessly from the melodic gems inherent in Schubert’s writing, through Bach’s urbanity, to the raw energy and sensuousness of Ginastera. Bach’s Italian Concerto was replete with crisp articulation, tasteful pedaling and, in the opening movement, sensitive attention to the different textures of orchestral and solo keyboard writing. The middle movement felt improvisatory at times (despite Bach’s “written out” ornaments), an expressive treble line floating over the bass. The final movement was open-hearted, its bright theme streaming forth with clarity and wit.</p><br>
<p>The three Danzas Argentinas by Alberto Ginastera demonstrate the composer’s strong interest in the folk music of his country with their vernacular scales, strummed textures, and lively dance rhythms. The middle of the triptych, “Dance of the Beautiful Maiden”, was sensuous and sultry, while the first and the last were colourful and earthy, Hammond adeptly harnessing the full dynamic range of the Wigmore Steinway to striking effect, particularly in the final fff glissando of the “Dance of the Arrogant Cowboy”, bringing the concert to a close with masterly panache.</p><br>
<p>But for me, it was Schubert’s Sonata in A, D.664 (1819), popularly known as the “little” A major Sonata (to differentiate it from his more substantial work from 1828 in the same key) that really stole the show. The work is genial and expressive, its serenely expansive opening melody belying the more assertive and melancholy passages which follow. A tender middle movement is built around a single theme, while the finale has the lilt of the Ländler, with nods to Beeethoven in its textures, and a wistful mood. Clare brought to the work an intense intimacy, through highly expressive and beautifully judged cantabile playing, delicacy of touch, and sympathetic attention to the score, thereby highlighting all the subtle shifts and colours in Schubert’s writing, and reminding us, above, all, that Schubert was a composer of songs.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'perfectly poised and poetic phrasing' - <em>James Simister</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Clare Hammond's lunchtime piano recital began with one famous baroque work - JS Bach's Italian Concerto - and ended with Maurice Ravel's tribute to another great Baroque composer - Le Tombeau de Couperin. In between she played an eclectic selection of relatively modern pieces.</p><br>
    <p>Clare Hammond introduced each piece and described Bach's Italian Concerto as light and joyful, which applies equally to her playing of it. In her hands this harpsichord music sounds as if it might indeed have been written for the piano. Ed Hughes's Orchid No. 5 received its world premiere. Its melody had echoes of plainsong and its beautiful style is reminiscent of Debussy, though with more muscular rhythms.</p><br>
    <p>Alberto Ginastera wrote his Danzas Argentinas to celebrate the gaucho or cowboy as the epitome of Argentina. Clare played three of these evocative Dances - the Old Herdsman, the Beautiful Maiden and the Arrogant Cowboy, which calls for great virtuosity and ends with a spectacular up and down glissando that Clare brought off in brilliant but unfussy style. Kenneth Hesketh's Horae were written for Clare, who performed the last three of the twelve. Finally Clare played Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin with perfectly poised and poetic phrasing yet infused with a warm vitality; the audience's fulsome appreciation was rewarded with an encore - an Air by Handel - to end this memorable recital.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'she found a crystalline beauty… much flair' - <em>Rian Evans</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Another winner who chose new music was Clare Hammond. Kenneth Hesketh's <em>Horae (pro clara)</em> is named for the twelve goddesses of Greek mythology who personified the hours between sunrise and sunset. Of the sequence of pieces written - as the title suggests - especially for her, Hammond played 'Auge' (daybreak) and 'Anatolia' (dawn). She found a crystalline beauty in the figurations of the former and brought out the latter's contrasts of colouring and texture with much flair. In the Scriabin, her phrasing of the wave-upon-wave of invention had the requisite sweep, and she captured too the frenetic, breathless, quality that marking of marking 'affanato' demands.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Hammond recalls both Myra Hess and Annie Fischer, great Beethoven pianists of bygone generations' - <em>Terry Blain</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'Some pianists hammer the instrument into submission, some caress it. Clare Hammond is firmly in the latter category, as her inaugural recital as this year's artist-in-residence in the School of Creative Arts at Queen's University clearly demonstrates. Beethoven's 'Appassionata Sonata' - a piece frequently rendered virtually unlistenable by the clattering pyrotechnics it can unleash in players - benefits from Hammond's unusually judicious approach. There's no dashing towards the next climactic eruption in her interpretation, no overloading with angst, no drenching of the music in spurious, excessive emotions. Hammond focuses instead on the broader contours of the musical argument, unravelling the sonata structure of the opening movement with uncommon clarity.</p><br>
    <p>Beethoven's explosions of temperament, when they come, are all the more startling as a consequence. Hammond undoubtedly has the physical power to encompass fully the swirling technical difficulties of the tempestuous finale, but is again careful not to rush the music into fevered incoherency. In her judicious balancing of the classical and romantic elements in the sonata, and her finely honed musicality of approach, Hammond recalls both Myra Hess and Annie Fischer, great Beethoven pianists of bygone generations.</p><br>
    <p>Scriabin's Sonata No. 5 in F sharp poses interpretative conundrums not dissimilar to the 'Appassionata', its sudden lurches between what Hammond terms 'phrases of inexpressively sensuous languor and of frenetic activity' making it difficult to hold the single movement together as a coherent listening experience. Hammond managed this balancing out of contending sensibilities with an artless ease, gliding unobtrusively from interludes of heady, perfumed rhapsody to others of cascading hyper-intensity. So often in Scriabin there's an unwholesome whiff of hothouse decadence: Hammond purifies the air breathed by the music, distilling moments of exquisite, lingering poetry for the listener'.</p><br>
    <p>Earlier, in a nod towards her new Queen's connections, Hammond includes 'Piani, Latebre', a work by Piers Hellawell, Professor of Composition at the university. It's an immediately appealing composition, Hammond's elegant dispatch of the twinkling note-clusters in the 'Impromptu' section underlining how clean her attack is on the keys, how carefully calibrated the decay of sound in her scrupulously voiced chordings.</p><br>
    <p>There's also a world premiere, a brace of short works by Hillsborough composer and conductor Hamilton Harty, discovered recently among the papers of a woman Harty apparently fell in love with in 1934, during a voyage to Australia. The first, 'Portrait', distantly echoes the Elgar of 'Chanson de Matin', while the longer 'Spring Fantasy' has a Schumann-like turn of phrase and sentiment, with twirls of Chopin filigree in the piano writing. Hammond's accounts of both pieces are charming.<p><br>
    <p>Shorter works by Szymanowski and Messiaen fill out the programme, which opens with a ruminative account of Handel's 'Suite No. 6 in F sharp minor'. It's a work originally written for harpsichord, and Hammond doesn't quite manage, on a modern Steinway, to give the trills and decorations of the opening 'Prélude' the easy fluency of her playing later in the evening. The concluding 'Gigue', though, is full of élan and elasticity.</p><br>
    <p>The abiding impression left by Hammond in this recital is that she's far from bring a self-advertisingly virtuosic player, a strutter of stages on the international piano circuit. Her playing is of an altogether more thoughtful and discerning quality, focused constantly on the music itself, searching out its deeper significances and inner verities.</p><br>
    <p>Perhaps that's why the Harty Room is loath to let her go on this occasion - she plays two encores (a Handel 'Air' and Scriabin's 'Étude in C sharp minor'), but the audience seems ready to continue listening. They get another chance when Hammond returns to Queen's in February 2013 for more workshops in performance and composition, and a lunchtime recital on February 21. Piano-lovers who can get there on the day should certainly be attending.'</p>

  <div class="listing-trailer">'Crisp precision and unflashy intelligence' - <em>Guy Dammann</em></em></div>
  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p> 'Still, there are occasions when artist and programme really gel. One was Clare Hammond's recital, which married Giles Swayne's 2008 Three Bagatelles for solo piano with two of Julian Anderson's Piano Etudes, and also featured a little-known study by Stephen Oliver. Hammond, who studies at the Guildhall, played from memory with crisp precision and unflashy intelligence. The second of the Swayne pieces requires the softest, most even touch for its delicately balanced tonality to stabilise, just as the brittle humour of the third could easily snap under less clever fingers. Similarly, Anderson's studies require minute command, not just over each note's attack, but also of each release. Most impressive, though, was her natural sense of pacing, allowing the hollowed-out climax of Pour les Arpèges Composées to gather like a wisp of smoke in sunlight before dissipating in a passing breeze.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p>'A fiery account of the Piano Sonata from Clare Hammond ended the first half, building on her performance of the same work at the Purcell Room in January during the PLG's week of new music and young performers. Once again she demonstrated a formidable technical command, as well as a strong affinity with the composer's quickly changing moods. A stern-faced first movement was darkly coloured, the mood lifting for a vivacious scherzo. Hammond performed the movements with as little break as possible, moving from the cold Passacaglia to the strident fugal subject of the finale with apparent ease. Her virtuosity was stunning at times, all the more so for being so dedicated to the composer's intentions.'</p>

  <div class="listing-details concealed">
    <p> 'So strongly does Clare Hammond identify herself with her composers that the music seemed to come from within her, rather than from the piano. This performer unites unflawed elegance with the ability to gauge every work's emotional measure. She opened with a selection of Schubert Impromptus, miniatures full of charm, but not all sweetness and light. Writing a century later, Olivier Messiaen liberally supplied those qualities in La Colombe (The Dove). This was effectively contrasted with Le Nombre Léger (Light Number) and a dramatically conceived Un Reflet dans le Vent (Reflection in the Wind). Alexander Scriabin's Sonate-Fantasie in G sharp minor lifted the poetry of a Chopin into mystical realms - realms which were charted with energetic conviction. The second half of the recital showed imaginative powers of a similar order. After an alfresco Bartok suite, Brahms' Two Rhapsodies (Opus 79) returned us to the Romantic mainstream. Vallée d'Obermann, from the "Swiss" volume of Liszt's Years of Pilgrimage, yielded an epic climax. The pianist's encore underlined the sheer agility of her mind and fingers.'</p>
