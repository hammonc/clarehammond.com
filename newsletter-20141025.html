<p>Next month sees the culmination of the Panufnik centenary with <strong><a href="http://www.panufnik100festival.com/"target="_blank">Panufnik 100: a family celebration</a></strong> at <strong><a href="http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on-book-tickets/curated-weeks/panufnik-100-a-family-celebration"target="_blank">Kings Place</a></strong> in London on the 30 November. Co-curated by Clare and the Brodsky Quartet, this one-day festival will include performances of well-loved chamber works by Andrzej and the London premiere of a quartet written in memory of her father by <strong><a href="http://www.roxannapanufnik.com/"target="_blank">Roxanna Panufnik</a></strong>. The UK premiere of <strong><a href="http://jempanufnik.com/"target="_blank">Jem Panufnik</a></strong>'s documentary 'My Father, the Iron Curtain and Me' will be hosted by Norman Lebrecht, photographs of Andrzej as composer and family man, taken by Camilla Panufnik FRPS, will be exhibited, and the day will finish with a cabaret evening, led by <strong><a href="http://jacquidankworth.com/"target="_blank">Jacqui Dankworth</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://charliewood.us/"target="_blank">Charlie Wood</a></strong>.

<p>Forged in the fires of the two World Wars, <strong><a href="http://panufnik.com/"target="_blank">Andrzej Panufnik</a></strong>'s compositional output is inextricably linked with the major social and political events of the 20th century. Born in Warsaw at the onset of the First World War, he lived through the German occupation of the city in the Second World War and participated in musical resistance activities with the composer Lutoslawski. Over the course of the conflict, Panufnik lost many of his closest relatives and saw his compositions consumed by the fires of the <strong><a href="http://www.warsawuprising.com/"target="_blank">Warsaw Uprising</a></strong>. Initially f&#234;ted by the socialist government, he became unable to compose suitably 'positive' music and, accused of bourgeois decadence, made a dramatic escape to Britain in 1954. Panufnik spent the next 40 years in the UK and was knighted for his services to British music in 1991.</p>
