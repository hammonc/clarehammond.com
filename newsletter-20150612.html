	      <td><p>Tomorrow, Clare will perform with trumpeter Simon Desbruslais as part of a <strong><a href="http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/plg-memorial-concert-for-john-91920?dt=2015-06-12"target="_blank">John McCabe Memorial Concert</a></strong> at the Purcell Room in London. Join them at 7.45pm to hear McCabe's magnificent <em>Sonata after William Byrd's 'Haec Dies'</em> and pay tribute to an inspirational composer.</p> 

<p>Simon and Clare recently gave the world premiere of a double concerto, <em>Saint Blue</em>, by American composer Geoffrey Gordon with the English String Orchestra. Inspired by two of Wassily Kandinsky's paintings, this vibrant and dynamic work is a valuable addition to the repertoire. See Simon and Clare discussing the piece <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBOHtU2GR_Y"target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Clare's performance of etudes by Philip Glass at a sold-out Barbican Hall in April was well received with the <em>Guardian</em> describing her as "a dazzling athlete". Her album of music by Andrzej and Roxanna Panufnik was commended as "one of the most important fruit of Panufnik's birthday celebrations last year" and her performance described as "outstanding - exuberant, expressive and emotional" in the Polish journal <em>Muzyka 21</em>.</p>

<p>Over the summer, Clare will record her third disc for BIS Records, of solo piano works by British composer <strong><a href="http://clarehammond.com/hesketh_disc.html"target="_blank">Ken Hesketh</a></strong>, to be released in autumn 2016. You can read more about current projects, including chamber collaborations and new works for piano and film, <strong><a href="http://clarehammond.com/projects.html"target="_blank">here</a></strong>.</p>
