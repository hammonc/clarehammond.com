title: Recital for the Macclesfield Musical Society, 22 September 2012

<p>I've just given my first recital for the Macclesfield Musical Society at the Heritage Centre, which was originally built as a Sunday school of gargantuan proportions! The whole building retains a Victorian feel, from the list of benefactors in the concert hall to the beautifully preserved schoolrooms, complete with a small organ and rather threatening slogans on the walls. Apparently "the wages of sin is death", which gave me pause for thought!</p>

<p>The society use a beautiful Steinway for their recitals which had real dynamic range and was a joy to play. I appreciated the opportunity to repeat much of the programme from Thursday's recital so soon as it means that I can try out new ideas in quick succession. This season is comparatively straightforward in that I have much less new repertoire to learn than usual. It's quite a treat not only because I don't feel that I'm scrambling from concert to concert, but also as I can really work in depth on the pieces and enjoy what they have to offer.</p>

<p>So now I have a brief rest before a duo recital with violinist Thomas Gould at Alleyn's School in London on the 1st October. We'll be playing sonatas by Brahms and Franck, and some Chopin Nocturnes which have been arranged for violin and piano. It's our first concert together and I'm looking forward to it!</p>
