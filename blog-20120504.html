<p>I'm now on the way back to visit my family in the Midlands and am gradually regaining my energy after a recital at <a href="http://www.winchestercollege.org/" target="_blank">Winchester College</a> last night. I was recently advised by a friend, who is a visual artist, that I needed to 'let go' in my performances so I used last night's concert as a testing ground and tried to follow her advice. Whether or not I succeeded is an open question, but the performance certainly felt more spontaneous and less constrained. There is so much to remember and so much detail to marshal when giving a piano recital that it's difficult to know precisely which aspects to 'relax' or 'set free' without risking a complete collapse. I opted for keeping a rigid hold on the pulse while allowing my subconscious to take care of everything else. On paper I must say this looks pretentious and I suppose it's questionable whether I've 'let go' at all. I'll just keep exploring and hope that I find something that works!</p> 

<p>As for the concert itself, the staff and students at Winchester College were very welcoming and they managed to attract an enthusiastic and supportive audience both from the College and the town itself. The hall in the Music School dates from the same period as St George's Bristol, although it's on a much smaller scale of course, and they have a beautiful organ on the far side from the stage. Winchester itself is such a beautiful city and, as the school itself is a familiar venue now, I was able to relax and enjoy the scenery.</p> 

<p>I now have to focus on Beethoven's 'Emperor' concerto which is a new work for me and which I'll perform with the <a href="http://ccso-online.org.uk/" target="_blank">City of Cambridge Symphony Orchestra</a> on the 12th May. I've done a number of concertos with them in the past, although it's been nearly two years since our last performance together. I'll hope that there are still some similar faces in the orchestra and will look forward to our first rehearsal early next week!</p>
