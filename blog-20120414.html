<p>The principal challenge of the past week or so has been to keep my eyes open during daylight hours and to avoid coughing during recitals. I went down with a bad bug a couple of weeks ago and spent a few days in bed desperately trying to recuperate before a closely spaced run of concerts. By Saturday 14th I was able to stand upright and, fortified by a substantial amount of cough linctus, gave a recital for the <a href="http://www.saffronwaldenmusic.org.uk/" target="_blank">Saffron Walden & District Music Club</a>. The programme included Beethoven's Appassionata sonata and Prokofiev's sixth, with works by Bach, Martin, Shostakovich and Szymanowski. It wouldn't have been an easy <a href="http://www.saffronwaldenmusic.org.uk/pages/contact.html#clare_hammond" target="_blank">programme</a> when in good health, and I was anxious that it would prove too much for me in my weakened state!</p> 

<p>Intriguingly enough, I found that a bout of illness can help to focus the mind. I was unable to devote the energy that I normally do to fussing about details which are probably not of great importance, and had to take a step back. In some ways, being forced to ration my energy over the course of a recital gave a greater sense of structure to the whole and the warmth of the audience was a great support. I recognised many faces from my performance there last year and giving a recital so close to home meant that family, friends and even dedicated piano pupils were able to come along!</p>

<p>The following Monday found me at the <a href="http://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/" target="_blank">Wigmore Hall</a> to give the final concert of a five-date tour with the Piatti String Quartet. This was superbly organised by the Park Lane Group and the Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust and was, all in all, an absolutely wonderful occasion. We were very excited when the BBC approached us to broadcast the evening as part of their 'Live in Concert' series, not least because it meant that many people who were unable to get to London could still tune in. The interview was a challenge as my voice had only just returned and was still on the husky side, but the 'Live in Concert' team made everything as straightforward as possible and were very supportive. We were delighted by the number of people who came to the hall that evening and very grateful for the standing ovation. For those of you who would like to listen again, my performance of Ravel's <em>Le Tombeau de Couperin</em> will be available <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/showcase/genres/classical#/clips/p00r6k6s/in/collection/p00b9xn8" target="_blank">online</a> until the 15 May as one of Radio 3's Classical Highlights.</p>

<p>After a couple of days beavering away at home, I left for The Wirral to give a recital of water music for the <a href="http://www.tworiversfestival.co.uk/" target="_blank">Two Rivers Festival</a> in Birkenhead. This was a particularly exciting evening as I was able to meet the five composers who had been commissioned to write <em>Aquarelles</em>, a series of five miniatures  celebrating the Debussy Centenary which I've been working on for some months. It was wonderful to have the chance to meet James Francis Brown, Peter Fribbins, David Matthews, Alan Mills and Robin Walker and to perform their pieces live to them. I had already sent recordings of each miniature to the composers, just to check that I was on the right track, but it makes such a difference to perform the pieces in real time in the same space as the person who wrote it. The audience listened intently throughout the evening to water pieces by Liszt, Ravel and Debussy, the <em>Prayer Bell Sketch</em> by Knussen and, of course, Ravel's <em>Tombeau</em>. I was very well looked after by members of the festival committee that evening and was well rested the next morning when we left for the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester.</p>
