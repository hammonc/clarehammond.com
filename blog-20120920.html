<p>I'm on the train back into London after a really enjoyable evening with the Brentwood Musical Society. They had a lovely piano and a supportive and responsive audience. I am absolutely exhausted now though! I may reconsider finishing a programme with the 'Appassionata' sonata. It's not an easy one to gather the energy for at the very end of a recital.</p>

<p>I opened this evening with one of my favourite pieces, Handel's Suite No. 6 in F sharp minor. Although it was not written for the piano originally, it does work extremely well on the instrument and I love its theatricality. Afterwards I was greeted backstage by <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/music/tbest.shtml" target="_blank">Terence Best</a>who had edited the Henle edition of the suite. I was very grateful that he hadn't introduced himself before the concert - it would have become a much more nerve-wracking experience!</p>

<p>I travelled through Stratford on the way here and saw the Olympic stadium in the flesh for the first time. It's very impressive, and even more beautiful illuminated at night. I may get a coffee at Liverpool Street - it might perk me up for the rest of the journey...</p>
