<p>I travelled to Hamburg this weekend to give a concert as part of the 400th-birthday celebrations of the <a href="http://anglican-church-hamburg.de/400years/" target="_blank">St Thomas Becket Anglican Church</a> in Hamburg. The English Church in Hamburg was founded in 1612 by the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London and moved, in the early 1800s, to its current location on the Zeughausmarkt. The building is neoclassical in style, with grand Greek columns, and the interior is simple, elegant and peaceful.</p>

<p>To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the church, a festival has been organised which includes a concert season running throughout the year. Mine was the third date of the series, following a gala benefit concert given back in February with the violinist <a href="http://www.danielhope.com/" target="_blank">Daniel Hope</a>, pianist <a href="http://www.sebastianknauer.com/" target="_blank">Sebastian Knauer</a> and conductor Jeffrey Tate. The acoustics in the church are beautiful and I had a rare chance to perform on a Schimmel piano. Both members of the church, and the audience themselves, gave me a very warm welcome and it was a pleasure to perform for them. I also managed to fit in some sight-seeing, which is unusual, so, all in all, had a wonderful trip.</p> 

<p>The festival runs until the end of the year and includes a large number of classical music concerts, regular choral evensong, lectures, guided walks, an African event and a church bazaar. Judging by the energy and vibrancy of the organising committee and congregation, it should be a fantastic year for them and anybody who can attend one of their events!</p>
