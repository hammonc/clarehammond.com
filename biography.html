<h3 class="page-heading">BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<p>Acclaimed by The Daily Telegraph as a pianist of <em>“amazing power and panache”</em>, Clare Hammond has performed across Europe, Russia and Canada and has appeared recently at the Wigmore and Barbican Halls in London and the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. Her Purcell Room debut for the Park Lane Group concert series was praised by The Guardian for its <em>“crisp precision and unflashy intelligence”</em>.</p>

<p>A passionate advocate of twentieth and twenty-first century music, Clare combines a formidable technique and virtuosic flair onstage with stylistic integrity and attention to detail. Since her debut with orchestra at the age of eleven, she has acquired a concerto repertoire of over 20 works which she has performed at major venues across the UK and on the continent. Solo engagements have included recitals in concert series and festivals across Britain, in France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and Russia.</p>

<div class="concealed">
  <p>Clare has just completed a five-date concert tour taking in St George's Hall Bristol, the Queen's Hall Edinburgh, and culminating at the Wigmore Hall London. The final concert was broadcast by BBC Radio 3 as part of their 'Live in Concert' programme and her performance of Ravel's <em>Le Tombeau de Couperin</em> was chosen as one of their Classical Highlights. Clare released her debut CD of British contemporary piano music at the beginning of the year for Prima Facie Records, and recently appeared on BBC Radio 3's 'In Tune' to promote the disc.</p> 

  <p> Forthcoming highlights include a BBC broadcast of etudes by Unsuk Chin, a residency at Queen's University Belfast in 2012/13, and the premieres of works written especially for Clare by composers Kenneth Hesketh and Robert Saxton. Keen to collaborate with composers, Clare has just premiered <em>Aquarelles</em>, a series of five miniatures commissioned to commemorate Debussy's 150th birthday from composers James Francis Brown, Peter Fribbins, Alan Mills, David Matthews and Robin Walker. An active chamber musician, Clare has worked with Andrew Kennedy, Jennifer Pike, Philippe Graffin, Lawrence Power, Ruth Palmer, Tatiana Berman and the Endellion, Dante and Benaïm String Quartets. She performs regularly with the flautist Ana de la Vega as the 'Duo Dounia' and with the Goldfield Ensemble. </p>
  
  <p>Eager to extend the boundaries of traditional concert life, Clare is intrigued by new perspectives that musicological study can bring to bear on performance. She has just completed a doctorate on twentieth-century left-hand piano concertos and was convenor for the RMA Study Day Performing Musicology, held at City University London in June 2011. Clare is in demand as a speaker and has been invited to give presentations at Oxford, Manchester, and Surrey Universities in the coming season. On the concert circuit, she enjoys introducing recitals, pre and post concert talks and giving lecture recitals and workshops to audiences of all levels.</p>

  <p>Clare completed a BA at Cambridge University, where she obtained a double first in music, and undertook postgraduate study with Ronan O’Hora at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and with Professor Rhian Samuel at City University London. She has been supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, Stradivari Trust, Martin Musical Scholarship Fund, Jessie Wakefield Bursary and the Kenneth Loveland Gift. Clare is represented by Liz Webb Management.</p>
