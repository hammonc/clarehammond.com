<p>And now a chance to perform for my home crowd! Last September my husband and I moved to Royston which is just south of Cambridge on the train line into London. After living in the capital for four years, I really appreciate the sense of community here (as well as the peace and quiet!) When we moved in the Royston Arts Festival was in full swing and I thought it would be fun to participate the following year. The committee already had plans for the 2013 in place but very kindly agreed to arrange an 'occasional event' outside of the festival itself. We were all a little nervous as this was a new venture for everybody, but the concert itself was a great success thanks to their hard work and dedication.</p> 

<p>The first challenge was to locate a suitable piano in town and we ultimately decided to put the Danemann at Greneway School through its paces. Despite some pretty fiery repertoire, it held up very well indeed. The staff at the school were extremely welcoming and helpful and the audience itself, composed largely of people from Royston and the surrounding area, was a delight. I spend so much time traveling to perform in unfamiliar places that it's a real pleasure to see neighbours, friends and pupils in the audience, and not to have to travel for hours to get home!</p>
