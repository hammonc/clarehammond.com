<p>This evening saw my first performance of Beethoven's 'Emperor' Concerto which, as a pianist, feels like a rite of passage. I've played with the <a href="http://ccso-online.org.uk/" target="_blank">City of Cambridge Symphony Orchestra</a> a number of times in the past (who, until recently, were known as the Cambridge String Players) and it was such a pleasure to return this time to familiar faces both in the audience and alongside me on stage.</p> 

<p>The most difficult thing in a concerto, for me at least, is to adapt my playing to match the enormous volume of sound and variety of timbre in an orchestra. I'm used to responding to smaller ensembles in chamber settings, but this is something very different, particularly given the brightness of the beautiful Steinway at West Road. My conception of the piece suddenly became monumental when we rehearsed together for the first time and I felt that I had to expand the length of phrases and the span of the piece as a whole, in some curious way!</p> 

<p>While I enjoyed the evening enormously, I must say that it was a relief when it was over. The first performance of a concerto is always nerve-wracking! I'm now going to spend a week focussing on contemporary British piano music before playing at the <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/" target="_blank">Brighton Festival Fringe</a> where I'll be promoting my debut CD, 'Piano Polyptych'. I'll be performing works by composers Philip Grange, James Francis Brown, David Matthews and Giles Swayne, some of which I've recorded while others have been learnt more recently. It will be a very different occasion from the Beethoven last night - in fact one of the best things about being a pianist is the variety of the repertoire that's available to perform!</p>
