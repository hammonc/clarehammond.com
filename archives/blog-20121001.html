<p>Tonight I gave my first recital with violinist <a href="http://www.thomasgould.com/" target="_blank">Thomas Gould</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.michaelcrofttheatre.org.uk/page.aspx?id=24" target="_blank">International Concert Series</a> at Alleyn's School in Dulwich. We performed sonatas by Brahms and Franck, some nocturnes by Chopin (arranged for violin and piano), and Thom threw in Bach's <em>Chaconne</em> in D minor for good measure, so it was a big programme!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.michaelcrofttheatre.org.uk/" target="_blank">Michael Croft Theatre</a> at the school is an excellent venue and they have a Steinway concert grand with a lovely mellow bass. Some of the lower chords sounded as if they were sinking into molten chocolate! It was a real pleasure to perform with Thom, who is an instinctive and compelling musician, and to try out some new repertoire, or at least new arrangements of old repertoire. Thom has been collecting transcriptions of Chopin Nocturnes and has almost found an entire set of arrangements for violin and piano. It's a slightly unnerving experience as a pianist to be suddenly left with only the bass-line, but equally intriguing to hear the melodic line played by an instrument which can truly sustain. They're certainly pieces to explore further in future!</p>
