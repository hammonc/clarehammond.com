<p>This week has been a pretty demanding one with three separate programmes of chamber music spread over four concerts. I started the week with a lunchtime concert at <a href="http://www.st-james-piccadilly.org/ConcertsIntro.html" target="_blank">St James's Piccadilly</a> in London performing Britten and Poulenc's sonatas for cello and piano with <a href="http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/orchestra/players/cellos/richard_birchall/" target="_blank">Richard Birchall</a>, who is currently playing with the Philharmonia Orchestra. We both arrived at the venue drenched to the skin and the rain continued to pound down throughout the concert! Although the acoustic there is extremely resonant, it seemed to suit both works and it was a pleasure to experiment with the sound in such a beautiful venue.</p>

<p>I then performed at another spectacular church in the heart of the City with flautist <a href="http://www.anadelavega.com/" target="_blank">Ana de la Vega</a> on Tuesday. <a href="http://ststephenwalbrook.net/" target="_blank">St Stephen's Walbrook</a> is a little known gem near Bank tube station. It's impossible to get a sense of quite how impressive the building is from its  unassuming exterior but I would certainly recommend making time for a visit if you ever have the chance. We performed a programme of Widor, Poulenc and Prokofiev in preparation for a recital on the Wednesday evening for Bob Boas' concert series near Oxford Circus. Our programme on Wednesday was composed primarily of French music, with a Bach sonata thrown in for good measure! We also gave our first performance of an Adagio by the composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mysliveček" target="_blank">Josef Myslivecek</a>. Ana has a strong interest in Czech music from the late eighteenth century and gave what may have been the first performance in Western Europe of Myslivecek's Flute Concerto in D with the English Chamber Orchestra in 2010. We've been researching Czech duo repertoire over the past few months and have unearthed a series of forgotten works by composers including Vanhal, Myslivecek and Benda. The Adagio is only a taster of what we hope will prove to be a fertile seam of new repertoire!</p> 

<p>A couple of days at home were followed by a trip to St Briavels in the Wye Valley. I performed for <a href="http://www.wyevalleymusic.org.uk/" target="_blank">Wye Valley Music</a> in the winter of 2010 and it was lovely to return to the area. The landscape surrounding the church is astonishingly beautiful, even when viewed through sheets of heavy rain. I shared the concert platform with violinist <a href="http://www.ruthpalmer.com/" target="_blank">Ruth Palmer</a> in a programme which combined solo and duo works. Ruth started the proceedings with Bach's third Partita in E major and I then played studies by Szymanowski and two pieces from Albéniz's <em>Iberia</em>. In the second half we performed Bartók's <em>6 Romanian Dances</em> and Franck's Sonata in A, then finished with Monti's <em>Csardas</em> as an encore. Pianists often complain about chamber parts which consist solely of "oom-pah" accompanimental chords on loop but I must say that it was a relief to have so little to do after the Franck, especially as I was better able to listen to Ruth's dazzling performance!</p> 

<p>I now have some time to regather my energies and to focus on a series of solo recitals in July followed by performances of Bach's fifth Brandenburg Concerto with the Constella Ensemble. The Bach is a new work for me and I am very excited about the collaboration. We'll be performing the concerto on modern instruments in two of the most stunning churches in London; St Stephen's Walbrook and <a href="http://www.stgeorgesbloomsbury.org.uk/" target="_blank">St George's Bloomsbury</a>.</p>
