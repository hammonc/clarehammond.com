<p>It's been a busy couple of days! I spent Friday evening in Petworth with violinist Ruth Palmer where we performed the first movement of Debussy's violin sonata for the Friends of Petworth Festival. It felt very odd to go such a distance, don concert dress and get psyched up for a performance only to be on stage for 5 minutes, but it was a lovely event and we were welcomed very warmly.</p>

<p>I returned home late and packed my suitcase for a weekend trip to the West Midlands. I've performed in Worcestershire before, but this was my first recital for the Redditch Concerts Society. The concerts are held in a church, perched rather incongruously on the top floor of a shopping centre, and they have a Bechstein from the 1920s which was fun to play. It had an entirely different tone and touch to more modern instruments. One lady told me afterwards that she had played on that piano during the war when it was housed in a factory canteen, although it has been expertly restored since then and was in very good condition!</p>

<p>I performed the same programme that I gave in Macclesfield a couple of weeks ago with a suite by Handel, preludes by Messiaen, Beethoven's 'Appassionata' sonata, water music by Liszt, Scriabin's 5th Sonata and Szymanowski's <em>M&#233topes</em>. The latter portray three legends from Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> and are tremendously evocative pieces. In the first, 'L'île des Sirènes', the Sirens' song pierces a texture of shimmering arpeggios and grows more strident as their attempts to lure Odysseus and his men onto the rocks become more desperate. In the second, Szymanowski introduces us to the nymph Calypso who fell very deeply in love with Odysseus, but who was later spurned. In the final movement, Odysseus has been abandoned by his men and lies unconscious on the shore. On awakening, he sees Princess Nausicaa and her handmaidens playing catch on the beach. One Greek philosopher even credited Nausicaa with the invention of ball games as she was the first person to be recorded in literature playing catch with a ball!</p>
