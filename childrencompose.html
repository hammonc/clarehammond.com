<h3 class="page-heading">CHILDREN COMPOSE! with composer Lola Perrin and pianist Clare Hammond</h3>


<p>“Children Compose!”, led by composer Lola Perrin and pianist Clare Hammond, is a trailblazing project which aims to encourage children to compose and perform their own pieces. In doing so, children gain ownership of the music that they play, feel less intimidated by a perceived need to perform ‘perfectly’, and learn to let their imaginations run wild. Using Lola’s recent publication, <em>28 Piano Pieces by Children</em>, as a starting point, this project will take place in two stages:</p><p>STAGE 1</p><p>Lola collaborates with music teachers at 5 schools in workshops, coaching them to teach children to compose short pieces for solo piano, piano duet or instrumental duo. This will be related to the work she has already done with her own piano pupils in her highly successful volume, <em>28 Piano Pieces by Children for Children</em>. </p><p>In each school, five children volunteer to join the initiative, thus there will be a total of twenty-five school children creating twenty-five new works. In schools lacking dedicated music teachers, Lola will work on-site with students in three, half-hour, individual composition sessions, to produce one piece per student. The works will then be put into Sibelius by Lola or the music teachers.</p><p>STAGE 2</p><p>Clare leads a two-hour workshop at the Southbank Centre with the children from local schools to experiment with their pieces, try out new sounds and percussive effects on the piano, and work with them to develop their ideas in a supportive and inspiring group setting. The workshop will end with a group performance in which the children play their pieces and, if they have written piano duets or instrumental duo pieces, perform alongside Clare.</p><p>After a short break, Clare will give a 45-minute recital to the twenty-five children, their teachers and families, other students from the five schools who wish to attend, and also the general public. The concert will be comprised of short pieces, each prefaced with lively spoken introductions, designed to open the children’s ears to a wide range of repertoire in an entertaining and stimulating way. Clare will include pieces from <em>28 Piano Pieces by Children for Children</em> in her programme while also giving the audience the chance to eavesdrop on an aristocratic eighteenth-century ball with Couperin, jive to Kapustin’s Russian jazz fusion, and meet Ginastera’s arrogant Argentinian cowboy!</p><p>This interactive and immersive project will foster two-way creative conversations between children and professional musicians in a way which is creatively enriching for all parties. </p><p><em>Suitable for children in Years 1 to 7, performing piano at Grade 1 level or above.</em></p>
