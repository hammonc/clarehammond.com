	      <td><p>Clare is about to start a series of solo recitals across the UK with a Slavic programme of music including works by Chopin and Rachmaninov, and Mazurkas by Szymanowski and Thomas Ad&#232;s. In February she performs for <strong><a href="http://www.musicatoxford.com/Concerts/Events1516/ClareHammond.html"target="_blank">Music at Oxford</a></strong>, Lakeside Arts in Nottingham, in Keele and Hartlepool, and also plays concertos by Mozart and Chopin in Luton.</p>

<p>Clare then travels to Poland to tour concertos by Mozart and his Czech mentor, <strong><a href="http://clarehammond.com/mys.html"target="_blank">Josef Myslivecek</a></strong>. Myslivecek's first keyboard concerto has not been performed since his death in 1781 and is currently unpublished. Clare has created her own edition of the work and will give the 'modern-day world premiere' with the <strong><a href="http://filharmoniakaliska.pl/"target="_blank">Kalisz Philharmonia</a></strong> and Adam Klocek, before taking it to Jelenia Gora and Lublin.</p>

<p>Clare was featured in the <strong><a href="resources/es.jpg"target="_blank">Evening Standard</a></strong> earlier in the week in connection with her performance in 'The Lady in the Van'. For those of you who missed the cinema release, the DVD is out on the 7 March!</p><br>
