  <h3 class="page-heading">CONTEMPORARY MUSIC</h3>

  <p>Clare frequently performs and commissions solo, chamber and concerto works from living composers and is a keen advocate of contemporary music. Over the past four years, she has given over 20 world premieres of works by composers including Ken Hesketh, Robert Saxton, John Woolrich, David Matthews, Edwin Roxburgh, John McCabe, and Andrzej and Roxanna Panufnik.</p>

  <p>Her debut recording, <a href="piano-polyptych.html" class="popupwindow" rel="height:550,width:750,scrollbars:1,status:1,resizable:0">Piano Polyptych</a>, for Prima Facie Records was comprised exclusively of contemporary works by British composers, while her first disc for BIS Records, <a href="panufnik_cd.html" class="popupwindow" rel="height:550,width:700,scrollbars:1,status:1,resizable:0">Reflections</a>, featured works by Roxanna Panufnik. Her most recent CD, <a href="etude.html" class="popupwindow" rel="height:550,width:850,scrollbars:1,status:1,resizable:0">Etude</a>, was released in February 2015 and includes études by Unsuk Chin and Nikolai Kapustin.</p>

  <p>In 2013 Clare premiered Robert Saxton's <em>Hortus Musicae</em>, Book 1 at the City of London Festival and will perform the second book of the set at the Presteigne Festival in 2016. The Guardian wrote of her performance of Ken Hesketh's <em>Horae (pro clara)</em> at the Cheltenham Festival in 2013 that she "displayed its scintillating passagework and poetic calm with great flair".</p>

  <p>Clare premiered the Debussy-inspired set of miniatures, <em>Aquarelles</em>, by James Francis Brown, David Matthews, Alan Mills, Peter Fribbins and Robin Walker, in 2012 and has since performed it at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, St David's Hall in Cardiff, St George's Hall in Bristol, and at the Presteigne, Brighton, Vale of Glamorgan and Alwyn Festivals. In 2010 Clare gave her Purcell Room debut with a recital of contemporary music for the Park Lane Group at which the Guardian praised her "crisp precision and unflashy intelligence" and the Telegraph cited the "amazing power and panache" of her performance.</p> 

  <p>Projects in 2015 included the commission of new works for <a href="pianoandfilm.html" target="_blank">piano and film</a> from Ken Hesketh and Ed Hughes and the premieres of concertos for trumpet and piano by Geoffrey Gordon and Toby Young with Simon Desbruslais and the English Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Kenneth Woods.</p>
