  <br><p>Lola Perrin is an American-born composer and pianist who lives and works in London. She specialises in music for solo and multiple piano, and piano 4-hands, has published her eight piano suites under own sheet music label and has two CDs of her compositions on general release. Other works include compositions for string ensemble and bass clarinet choir. She also works with various authors and poets to create performances of piano music combined with the live spoken word. Her current projects include a forthcoming composition setting words by the Saudi Arabian blogger Raif Badawi to be premiered in Berlin later this year, and touring ‘Now You See It’, a substantial work launched in 2015 which combines the recorded spoken inner meditations of environmentalists and inventors around the world with live piano performance to engage with our modern day struggle for climate justice. She is a piano teacher with a thriving private practice and has published a book of compositions by her students entitled 28 Piano Pieces By Children For Children, a fundraiser for Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research.</p><br>
