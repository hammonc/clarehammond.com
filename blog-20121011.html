<p>I'm now home after a very tiring few days! I've spent this week in Belfast, teaching students in performance and composition workshops and giving individual piano lessons. On Thursday evening I gave a recital at <a href="http://www.music.qub.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen's University</a>, in association with <a href="http://www.movingonmusic.co.uk/" target="_blank">Moving On Music</a>. The concert took place in the Harty room which was oddly fitting as the <a href="http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/5280/0/1/classical-review-clare-hammond" target="_blank">programme</a> included world premieres of two works by Hamilton Harty which have only just been rediscovered, some 80 years after they were composed.</p>

<p>Harty wrote <em>Portrait</em> and <em>Spring Fantasy</em> for a young woman called Lorie Bolland, with whom he fell deeply in love on a voyage to Australia. She had been married for a year and showed no signs of reciprocating his passion, yet he wrote two piano pieces and numerous, extended letters to her. While she was interested in the visual arts and literature, she had no musical training so was unable to play the pieces herself. They lay in a packing case with other documents until they were rediscovered by her son, Christopher Bolland. Word of the documents gradually found their way to the Harty Professor at Queen's University Belfast, Jan Smaczny, who went to London to view them and realised their importance. I was very fortunate to be asked to premiere the pieces and Jan and I gave an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01n8c5t/Arts_Extra_09_10_2012/" target="_blank">interview</a> on BBC Radio Ulster to Marie-Louise Muir on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Another highlight of the programme was the Northern Irish premiere of <em>Piani, Latebre</em> by <a href="http://www.piershellawell.com/" target="_blank">Piers Hellawell</a>. Originally written for <a href="http://www.williamhoward.co.uk/" target="_blank">William Howard</a> and premiered at the <a href="http://www.spitalfieldsmusic.org.uk/" target="_blank">Spitalfields Festival</a> in 2010, the work comprises an introduction and three movements which can be arranged in any order the performer wishes. I've been working on the piece for a while now and love the imaginative way Piers approaches the instrument. I now just have to keep my eyes peeled for opportunities to perform the work again!</p>
