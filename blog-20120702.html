title: Two recitals in London, 1-2 July 2012

<p>I've just given two recitals in London on consecutive evenings, one for the <a href="http://www.thedysartarms.co.uk/music.htm" target="_blank">Dysart Arms</a> in Richmond, and another for the Park Lane Group's 'Bravo Beethoven' series at <a href="http://www.st-james-piccadilly.org/ConcertsIntro.html" target="_blank">St James's Piccadilly</a>. The Dysart Arms is a restaurant primarily but, on moving to their current location, they decided to install a Bechstein and now run a concert series. I performed a programme of works by Liszt, Beethoven, Bach, Hesketh, Satie and Alb&#233;niz and the concert itself was a very intimate occasion. It's rare to have the audience seated so close to the piano but I enjoyed the atmosphere that it creates.</p>

<p>The recital at St James's was a very different affair. The church is spectacular and the acoustic is extremely resonant. I particularly enjoy performing on their Fazioli grand which has a very even keyboard and is very reliable. I always know what this instrument is going to do, which is very reassuring as pianos change so much from month to month that I rarely know what to expect, even at a familiar venue! I performed Beethoven's Variations on 'God Save the King' to open the evening, and was followed by the flautist <a href="http://www.rosannater-berg.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rosanna Ter-Berg</a> and pianist <a href="http://www.leonicholson.co.uk/LN11/Home.html" target="_blank">Leo Nicholson</a>, who performed his Serenade Op. 41. I then returned to play what was billed on the flyer as a 'Surprise Work', a piece of contemporary music which was not listed in the programme. The audience were required to guess the composer afterwards and whoever was successful would win a bottle of champagne. The composer <a href="http://www.kennethhesketh.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ken Hesketh</a> has just written a series of twelve miniatures for me called <em>Horae</em> so I selected three for this concert. They're beautiful pieces and worked so well in the acoustic. Nobody guessed who had written the pieces so the champagne was awarded to Ken, who promptly passed it over to me! After the interval I performed Beethoven's 'Appassionata' sonata which is both monumental and draining. I find the third movement in particular very exciting. It's absolutely vital to keep a hold on the tempo in order to stop it from scooting out of control, and this in itself creates a tension which propels the music in a perversely uncompromising way. A wonderful work, but pretty gruelling at times!</p>

<p>I now have to prepare Bach's Brandenburg fifth concerto, which I'll play with the Constella Ensemble. We'll be performing the Brandenburg the week after next, at two different venues in London, with <a href="http://www.anadelavega.com/" target="_blank">Ana de la Vega</a> on flute and <a href="http://tatianaberman.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tatiana Berman</a> on solo violin. It's the first time I've played this concerto and it will be interesting to see how it works on modern instruments (I'm afraid that I won't be switching to the harpsichord for the occasion!)</p>
