	<p>Clare has recently had two broadcasts on BBC Radio 3. Her new CD, <strong><a href="http://www.clarehammond.com/panufnik.html"target="_blank"><em>Reflections</em></a></strong>, was featured on <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tmtz"target="_blank">CD Review</a></strong> (at 1.28.26) and she appeared as a guest on <strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tp0c "target="_blank">In Tune</a></strong> yesterday (at 48.47 and again at 1.34.16). These broadcasts are available to listen to online for the rest of the week.</p>

	<p>Clare's disc has been selected as an <strong><a href="http://www.rhinegold.co.uk/magazines/international_piano/"target="_blank">International Piano Choice</a></strong> in July and an interview with her on left-hand piano music has been published in the same edition of the magazine. You can also find an interview with Clare in this month's issue of <strong><a href="http://www.classicalmusicmagazine.org/"target="_blank">Classical Music Magazine</a></strong>.</p>

	<p>Concerts in July include the first of recitals to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Andrzej Panufnik. Clare will fly to Poland to perform at the Summer Festival Zakopane on the 11th July before returning to the UK to give performances at the <strong><a href="http://www.ryedalefestival.com/index.php/ryedalelistings/afternoon-concert-ryedale-festival-world-premier"target="_blank">Ryedale</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.buxtonfestival.co.uk/music-series/jessie-ann-richardson-clare-hammond/"target="_blank">Buxton Festivals</a></strong>.
