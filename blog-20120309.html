<p>Since the economic crisis hit, it has been difficult to avoid expressions of concern about the precarious state of funding for the arts. Classical music is rarely a fertile ground for fortune-hunters and it is hard enough for promoters to keep a concert series going in times of economic boom. Over the past couple of years reports of funding being withdrawn have become ever more numerous. From my perspective, concert proposals that I submit to festivals or institutions can be greeted with enthusiasm only to be followed with a caveat about the difficult financial situation.</p> 

<p>On Friday I performed for 'Music from the Gallery', a series of classical music concerts held at the library at Kidderminster. This concert society has been going for over 40 years yet, until four months ago, they weren't even sure whether they would have sufficient funding to continue their programme in 2012. They provide evenings of music to between 70 and 90 people, many of whom have been attending for decades. The feeling of community is palpable and I loved performing for them because I could communicate with the audience so directly.</p> 

<p>They had an excellent Steinway grand, which is owned by the local authority, and which I imagine would be used far less frequently if 'Music from the Gallery' were to fold. Concert societies across the country provide such a valuable service for their audience members, not only in a musical but also in a social sense, and they contribute so much to the life of the community as a whole. However dramatic this sounds, it is truly tragic when they close down, particularly after a successful career of half a century or so. I just hope that 'Music from the Gallery', and their like, can secure funding for another 40 years as they certainly deserve it.</p>
