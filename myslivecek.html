<h3 class="page-heading">Josef Myslivecek - Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in B flat major (undated)</h3>

<p>Clare has discovered a keyboard concerto by Josef Myslivecek (1737-1781), a Czech composer who was a close friend and mentor of Mozart. There had been no recorded performance of this work since Myslivecek's death until Clare gave the 'modern-day world premiere' in Kalisz in Poland on the 26 February 2016. Further performances took place in Jelenia Gora and Lublin.</p>

<p>The newly discovered keyboard concerto is in B flat major and lasts just over 12 minutes. It bubbles with energy and vitality and is a fascinating addition to the repertoire.</p>
