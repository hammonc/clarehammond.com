  <p><br>"A pianist by training, Kenneth Hesketh is particularly known for his orchestral compositions, of which Sir Simon Rattle, Vasily Petrenko and Oliver Knussen, among others, are advocates. The four works for piano presented on this disc, magnificently interpreted by the dedicatee of the principal piece, Clare Hammond, extend like a great liquid landscape which, despite the divisions between tracks, push the listener to hear them without stopping, so captivating is this music. Here one is in a resolutely tonal universe, where the influence of the Dutilleux of the "Figures de RÃ©sonances" is palpable. Beyond what he took from his professor at Tanglewood, one can find distinct recollections of the Scriabin of the last sonatas. Superlative sound quality illuminates the ease with which Clare Hammond masters the complexities of this programme."
