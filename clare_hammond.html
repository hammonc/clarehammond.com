  <br><p>Acclaimed as a pianist of "amazing power and panache" (<em>The Telegraph</em>), Clare Hammond is recognised for the virtuosity and authority of her performances and is developing a "reputation for brilliantly imaginative concert programmes" (<em>BBC Music Magazine</em>, 'Rising Star'). In 2014 she gave debut performances at 7 festivals across Europe, including the 'Chopin and his Europe Festival' in Warsaw, and world premieres of works by 10 composers.</p><br>

<p>Clare's latest disc release, 'Etude', received unanimous critical praise for its "unfaltering bravura and conviction" (<em>Gramophone</em>), was selected as Critic's Choice by <em>Classical Music Magazine</em>, and the <em>BBC Music Magazine</em> stated that "this array of wizardry is not for the faint-hearted". Both 'Etude' and Clare's previous disc of music by Andrzej and Roxanna Panufnik, 'Reflections', were featured on BBC Radio 3's 'In Tune' and 'CD Review'.</p><br>

<p>Education and outreach form an important part of Clare's work. In recent years she has given workshops and concerts for children of 4-16 years of age at the Hebden Bridge Piano Festival, Bledington Festival, Newburyport Chamber Music Festival (USA), and the Junior Academy of Music in Belfast. She has led seminars and workshops with undergraduate and postgraduate composers at the RNCM, Cardiff and Belfast Universities.</p><br>
