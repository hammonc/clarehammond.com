<h3 class="page-heading">Etude: <em>a solo recital disc</em></h3>

<p>Pianist Clare Hammond is in the process of raising £7,850 to record a CD of &#233;tudes by composers Unsuk Chin, Claude Debussy, Karol Szymanowski and Nikolai Kapustin. Clare recorded the &#233;tudes by Unsuk Chin, written between 1995 and 2003, for BBC radio last year and was captivated by them. Entirely absorbing and electrifying pieces, they are natural successors to the piano &#233;tudes by György Ligeti and are already of international prominence.</p>

<p>The &#233;tudes by Szymanowski, Debussy and Kapustin have all been chosen both to complement the Chin, and to provide variety. Each are strikingly original examples of the genre and demand versatility and panache from the performer. This disc would be of great artistic interest to music-lovers and would represent an important milestone in Clare's career.</p>
