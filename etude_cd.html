<h3 class="page-heading">Étude: <em>a solo recital disc</em></h3>

<p>Pianist Clare Hammond is seeking to raise £10,000 to record a CD of &#233;tudes by composers Unsuk Chin, Karol Szymanowski, Sergei Lyapunov and Nikolai Kapustin with <a href="http://www.bis.se/index.php" target="_blank">BIS Records</a>. Clare recorded the &#233;tudes by Unsuk Chin, written between 1995 and 2003, for BBC radio last year and was captivated by them. Entirely absorbing and electrifying pieces, they are natural successors to the piano &#233;tudes by György Ligeti and are already of international prominence. The &#233;tudes by Szymanowski, Lyapunov and Kapustin have all been chosen both to complement the Chin, and to provide variety. Each are strikingly original examples of the genre and demand versatility and panache from the performer.</p> 

<p>This disc will represent an important milestone in Clare’s career and will help propel her into the next level of the profession. With suitable publicity, the disc should secure reviews and coverage in the national and international musical press enabling Clare to obtain recitals with more prestigious festivals and concert series. A tour is planned for the launch of the CD, which will raise her profile further, and she should be able to secure more engagements abroad using the disc as a calling card.</p>

<p>Clare will be giving two fund-raising <a href="http://www.clarehammond.com/concerts.html" target="_blank">concerts</a> in February 2013, one in Cambridge and one in London. If you would like to contribute, but are unable to come to either of the concerts, details of how to donate are available <a href="donations.html" class="popupwindow"
