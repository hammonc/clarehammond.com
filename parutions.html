  <p><br>"After a remarkable recording dedicated to the solo piano works of Andrzej and Roxanna Panufnik, the pianist Clare Hammond turns to the "pianistic etude" as a musical genre, with an original programme comprising four works by four different composers.</p><br>
  <p>First of all, Sergei Lyapunov (1859-1924) with three pieces taken from his 12 Transcendental Etudes, then Unsuk Chin (born in 1961) and her etudes for piano, which were composed between 1995 and 2003. Next we find the Ukrainian composer Karol Szymanowski (1882-1937) and his 12 Etudes, Op. 33, then, to finish this attractive sequence, Nikolai Kapustin (born in 1937) and his Five Studies in Different Intervals, Op. 68.</p><br>
<p>It is with energy, conviction and fervour that Clare Hammond presents these works in a musical torrent of the utmost inspiration. Virtuosity here is at the service of the music and only acts to reinforce the rigorous dedication of a diligent artist. An SACD of superlative quality."</p><br>
