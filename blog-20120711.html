<p>I'm now on the train back from Preston where I've just given a lunchtime recital for the <a href="http://tictec.co.uk/promoters/ribble-valley-international-piano-week/40" target="_blank">Ribble Valley International Piano Week</a>. This is a wonderful festival, directed by the pianist <a href="http://www.martinroscoe.co.uk/" target="_blank">Martin Roscoe</a>, and I was very excited to be taking part. I was fortunate enough to hear <a href="http://www.jinju.it/" target="_blank">Jin Ju</a>'s recital yesterday evening, which was absolutely breath-taking. If you haven't heard her perform yet then I'd certainly recommend hearing her at the first possible opportunity!</p>

<p>I started my recital today with Bach's <em>Italian Concerto</em> then performed works by Liszt, Satie, Debussy and Alb&#233;niz. The piano was absolutely superb. Yamaha have recently released a new concert grand and had loaned the piano to the festival for the week. It had been extremely well set up by the resident technician, <a href="http://www.mbailey-pianotuner.co.uk/" target="_blank">Marianne Bailey</a>, and was an absolute joy to play. The action, in particular, was light, fleet and responsive - all of the things that you need, but very rarely get! The audience were welcoming and the committee very kindly took me out for lunch afterwards so, all in all, it's been a lovely day. I'm exhausted now though - the Brandenburg yesterday was good fun but surprisingly tiring. I'll be glad to have a few days to rest at home now!</p>
