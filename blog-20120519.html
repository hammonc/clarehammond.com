<p>Today was a tiring one as I travelled to Brighton and back for an afternoon performance at the <a href="http://www.brightonfestivalfringe.org.uk/" target="_blank">Brighton Festival Fringe</a>. I was playing as part of an event organised by ASC Records to promote my debut CD, 'Piano Polyptych'. My programme was a short one, at half an hour, yet intense as it featured some of the trickiest contemporary music that I have in my repertoire.</p>

<p>I started with Giles Swayne's fourth bagatelle, 'Wasserklang', which is fiendish. I love the piece and it's extremely effective in concert, although it's very tiring to sustain such drama and energy over a long span. There was then a peaceful interlude of two of the <em>Aquarelles</em> which I premiered in The Wirral in April. I performed the two miniatures by James Francis Brown and David Matthews, before launching into Philip Grange's <em>Piano Polyptych</em>. The latter is a monumental work which encompasses a vast range of characters, techniques and textures. Needless to say, this was also exhausting! I dozed all the way home and shall rest tomorrow before starting on the repertoire for my chamber concerts in June. I'm really looking forward to working with other musicians, particularly as this year has been very heavy on the solo front so far.</p>
