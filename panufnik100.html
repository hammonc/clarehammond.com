<h3 class="page-heading">PANUFNIK 100: a family celebration</h3>







<p>In November 2014 Clare co-curated a chamber festival with the <a href="http://www.brodskyquartet.co.uk/" target="_blank">Brodsky Quartet</a> to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Anglo-Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik's birth. The festival was held at <a href="http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/" target="_blank">Kings Place</a> in London and featured two chamber concerts, a film screening, foyer performances and a cabaret evening. Clare performed alongside mezzo soprano Heather Shipp and the Brodsky Quartet, while other artists included the Panufnik Family, Norman Lebrecht, film director Krzysztof Rzacynski, cellist Richard May, violist Robert Smissen, jazz singer Jacqui Dankworth and jazz pianist Charlie Wood.</p>

<p>The festival was hailed as the "culmination in every sense" of the centenary year by Richard Whitehouse in Classical Source. Michael Write praised the Brodskys for the "searing intensity" of their performance in the Telegraph while Fiona Maddocks described Roxanna Panufnik's new string quartet as "spirited and direct" in the Observer. With over 900 tickets sold, the festival brought Andrzej Panufnik's music to a wide audience and was featured in publications including the Classical Music Magazine, Gramophone Magazine, Time Out, Musical Opinion, Auditorium Magazine, and blogs by Jessica Duchen and Norman Lebrecht.</p>

<p>Clare co-curated and co-managed the festival and was responsible for fundraising, securing grants from the Polish Cultural Institute, John S Cohen Foundation, RVW Trust, Hinrichsen Foundation and the Arts Council England.</p>
